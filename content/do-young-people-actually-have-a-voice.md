Children and young people are told that they have a voice, the ability to make change, we are the future after all, but are children and young people really listened to? Do our MPs/MSPs in government, who are supposed to listen to us, actually care about our opinions and concerns regarding our lives and futures? Unfortunately, I have found that they might not.  

Back in December I wrote letters to various people: senior advisors to the Scottish Parliament, legal experts who specialise in children’s rights in Scots Law, even the Scottish Minister for Children and young people and her advisers, all of whom I am still awaiting a reply from. 

Below is the letter that I sent to Ms Clare Haughey the Scottish Minister for Children and Young People: 

 

Dear Minister 

I am 16 years old and I am concerned that certain aspects of the new National Guidance for [Child Protection in Scotland 2021](https://www.gov.scot/publications/national-guidance-child-protection-scotland-2021/pages/2/) , published this month by the Scottish Government, breach my rights as a young adult. 

I know that there are several legal definitions of a child in Scots law but at the age of 16 years I have certain adult rights, for example, to vote (in some elections), to marry, to leave home and to apply for a council house. It is generally accepted that a 16 year old is not a child in the sense that they need the same supervision and control.  My parents do not have ‘rights’ in respect of me now I am 16 and they only ‘responsibility’ they retain until I am 18 is to provide me with guidance.  

The new child protection guidance applies to young people aged up to 18 years. (1.7  child protection procedures may be considered for a person up to the age of 18 p. 8).   

This means that, if I was a victim of abuse or assault (or someone thought that I might be at risk of becoming a victim), I would be brought into a children’s process –even though I am not a child.  

I am also worried that new guidance includes non-familial incidents where a young person (including 16-18 year olds) are harmed or at risk of harm out with the home, for example, assaulted by a stranger within the community.  The guidance applies even where there is no suggestion of parental lack of care or concern about parents’ capacity to protect.   I really don’t understand this because, even if my parents were in some way culpable for the harm which occurred out with my family, how can they be held accountable in a child protection sense given that they have no rights and only the responsibility to provide ‘guidance’? 

I understand that if I was assaulted by a stranger the test of ‘significant harm’ would still require to be met in order for child protection procedures to be instigated. However, whether or not there is a risk of significant harm isn’t really the point – my situation would still be considered for a child protection response when I am not a child. If I was 18 years old, this consideration would not be happening.  

The section I am particularly worried about concerns ‘Inter-agency Referral Discussions or IRDs’. I have two worries about how these IRDs breach my rights to privacy as a young adult.   IRDs are a process for police, social work, education and health to discuss protection concerns about a particular child and to agree whether a child protection response is needed.  The guidance states that: 

An inter-agency referral discussion (IRD) is the start of the formal process of information sharing, assessment, analysis and decision-making following reported concern about abuse or neglect of a child or young person up to the age of 18 years, in relation to familial and non-familial concerns, and of siblings or other children within the same context. p. 91 

The new guidance means that young people aged 16-18 years can be discussed at an IRD even though there is no child protection response possible for a young person aged over 16 years. It is not possible to place a 16-18 year old on the child protection register because there are no legal measures available to a local authority social work department to take action to enforce a child protection plan, such as a Child Protection Order or a Compulsory Supervision Order. So what purpose is there to professionals from various agencies discussing my personal information?   

Not only is information discussed, the guidance says that: 

All aspects of the IRD must be recorded….. This will form a single core IRD record, to be shared by participant agencies. p.91 

Practitioners in police, social work and health must participate in the IRD…Information gathering should involve Education/ELC; and other services working together to ensure child safety, as appropriate. This may include Third Sector services. p.92 

So if I was, for example, assaulted by neighbour on the street and I reported it to the police, they would call an IRD and then all of my personal information – totally irrelevant to the common assault- would be discussed by professionals I don’t even know and then recorded and kept by agencies. I gather this means that social work would open a file about me and that my school would be told about a visit to a sexual health clinic?  Would I even know this is happening? Do I have any right to object? I can find nothing in the guidance which says I have any rights in this process. It all just happens in the background because I report an assault to the police. This would put me off reporting a crime to the police!  

I believe that this breaches my data privacy rights because how can it be necessary and/or proportionate for social workers, police, health and education staff to (i) be told that I was assaulted by a stranger on the street; (ii) to then share my personal information during an IRD; and (iii) record it all on a file. What is the purpose of this when I am a young adult and more importantly, at no ‘child protection’ risk within my family. What if I am not even living with my family?  

I also think this is contrary to the UNCRC which makes clear that young people have a right to be involved in decisions which affect them. I looked up online to see what age a child is in terms of the UNCRC and the new Scottish law says it will apply to young people up to the age of 18 years. I am not a lawyer, but I don’t see how this can be when other Scots law defines a child as under 16 years. I also read that when the UNCRC is adopted by the government, it will make it unlawful for public authorities to act in ways incompatible with the charter. Does this mean that the new guidance is potentially unlawful? 

I would be grateful if you could look into this for me, please, and advise whether you agree that the new child protection guidance upholds my rights as a young person in Scotland. 

Yours faithfully, Lily Cornell 

 

This letter is asking questions that I believe to be crucial in protecting the rights of children in Scotland, and the Minister who is supposed to do just that, 

A) hasn’t fulfilled that in her new policy 

b) and also hasn’t listened to the views of one of the young people she is supposed to listen to.
