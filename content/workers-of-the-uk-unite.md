Just tonight BBC news was reporting on the newest strike in the UK, nearly 2,000 workers have started an eight day strike at the UK’s largest container port over pay dispute. We've seen rail workers, bus drivers, bin lorry drivers, ferry crews, postal workers, airport staff, and most recently the port operators going on strike this year, all over pay disputes and working conditions. What were the demands being shouted from the picket lines? Keeping their income the same as before in real terms, in a defined quantity it’s ten percent or there about for all of these groups, just enough to keep up with the current inflation in the UK. The reasoning and justification is as simple as this – why should those at the top of the company be reaping in large profits while those who do the heavy lifting face a looming cost of living crisis and an ever-reducing wage (in real terms). For example, Unite, the union representing the striking workers, has stated that “The company has prioritised delivering multi-million-pound dividends rather than paying its workers a decent wage.” and the company has been widely reported to have earned “pre-tax profits of £61 million in 2020, when it also paid out £99 million in dividends”. So another argument is why are workers not being given a fair pay rise when £99 million can be spent paying out dividends to other wealthy stockholders and the coffers are expanding by £60 million a year? Why aren’t those who do the work that allows these profits to be made being paid fairly for their work when the money is there?

Corporate greed is a common theme in most of these strikes, companies making large profits and yet this profit not trickling down to the workers. Network rail on its own has 26 executives on over £200,000 and 73 on more than £150,000 salaries, those at the top, including Andrew Haines (Chief Executive) and Jeremy Westlake (Chief Financial Officer), earned £585,000 and £415,000 a year respectively according to the Transport Salaried Staff’s Association (TSSA). Now, it’s important to note that strikes are not over the pay of the bosses, but it does put into perspective the wealth of network rail and the salaries offered to those higher up, surely to goodness instead of adding to the 73 or the 26, those at the bottom of the ladder should be given a share of this fortune. I think TSSA puts this best: “As the industry says we should tighten our belts, the top 73 highest earners at Network Rail earn a combined total of £15 million per year. Are we really all in this together?”.

That hits the nail on the head, this year has seen terrible inflation and increasing costs of living, with many families expected to be unable to afford the cost of heating this winter, those at the top of the companies faced with strikes don’t feel this, they don’t need to make choices between heating and eating, so people feel even more alienated from their employers than before. It turns out its quite hard to explain to your employees why you deserve to be earning more than double the average price of a house every year, while they struggle to pay each month’s rent on time.
