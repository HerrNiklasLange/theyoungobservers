'Rights - a moral or legal claim to have or get something or to behave in a particular way' - Oxford dictionary.



In 1948 the universal humans right has been signed by the United Nations with none of the members voting and denying the basic rights to everyone; such as the right to education, to start a family and many others. These right have been mostly uphold across the world but the right to housing; which the government needs to supply its: workers, citizens and refuges, have been denied or are only available to those who have money or that have 'proven themselves' through impossible demands that they truly deserve the rights to housing.

###### Eleanor Roosevelt holding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948

Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises the right to housing as part of the right to an adequate standard of living. It states that:
Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.

With so many countries having signed the universal declaration of human rights then why are so many people homeless? 
Both the United States and Britain have signed it but in Britain By the end of 2021, 227,000 households across Britain were experiencing the worst forms of homelessness. and in the US it is over half a million . This is a failure of these 'great' nations to their people and the unimaginable loss of funds for the state and less money spend in the economy because most jobs require an address. But you cannot afford an house if you don't have a job. This catch 22 makes it so hard for people to escape the grips of poverty and many people still blame that it is their fold that they are homeless and not the injustice system that disables or makes it incredible difficult  for them to get above the poverty line.

This only gets worse when we add the unprecedented pandemic and the cost of living crises. To counter this some governments have implemented a housing first policy with great success. Countries such as Finland have implemented a housing first policy: granting housing for people unconditionally and having voluntary program to help them deal with their addictions and/or issues.

###### One of the apartment complexes built as part of Finland's national homelessness strategy.

 By supplying a safe and warm apartment, homeless people or rough sleepers can try and focus on solving their problem without needing to wonder where they will sleep tonight or how they will survive the next day. And the results? Finland is the only country in Europe where homeless is decreasing, reduced its long-term homelessness by 35% , rough sleeping does not exist in cities like Helsinki and over 3,500 homes have been build since its establishment is 2008. Resulting in many new jobs for people and gaining valuable taxpayer money from the former rough sleepers and homeless that have found a job to do housing first policy. 
With this all said Finland is a small country compared to Britain and the US and it would be a lot harder to implement this is a country with hundreds of million people, but it has shown us that the state can provide basic right and humans right to its people at least on a local level if it wanted to.
