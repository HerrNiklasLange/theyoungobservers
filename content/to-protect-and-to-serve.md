This month the Metropolitan Police appointed Mark Rowley(pictured below) as the new Commissioner of the UK’s biggest force, after Cressida Dick resigned after the mayor of London Sadiq Khan made clear that he and his constituents had lost faith in her leadership. It’s not hard to see why, in her time in the role, the Met were overrun with scandals: the rape, kidnap and murder of Sarah Everard, the stop and search of GB athlete Bianca Williams, her partner and three-month-old daughter, where officers ignored her pleas and violently dragged her and her daughter out of the car, the reluctance to investigate Partygate or to discipline officers (including Couzen’s) actions that involved a number of deeply racist and misogynistic WhatsApp messages. All this behaviour going on within the Met only allows for a toxic culture to grow, one that allows racist, homophobic and sexist behaviours to be played down as ‘office banter’, for officers to abuse their power for their own interests and unfortunately all of this ends up in the public, the people that they should be protecting, not having any faith in them.

So, what must change? Well for a start Rowley must carry out some tough love on his officers, the Met must stop defending the officers that are proving people that they can’t trust the police. This will be hard for Rowley, and the decisions that will have to be made will be unpopular amongst many officers, but the Met can no longer defend the indefensible. These decisions must happen to deliver his promise to ‘renew policing by consent- more trust, less crime, and high standards’. It is also necessary to wrong the findings of the Macpherson Inquiry which found the Met to be ‘institutionally racist’, and unfortunately, despite this inquiry being conducted more than 20 years ago, this view is held by many people in the UK. This view isn’t without merit, Chris Kaba was shot dead by officers in South London this month, no gun has been linked to the 24-year-old victim, which lead Kaba’s family to accuse the Met of being once again, institutionally racist.

If Rowley cannot get his house in order, then how on earth can the public trust those who are there to protect them?
