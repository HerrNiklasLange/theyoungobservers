Which year are we living in, 1930? 1850? 1770? But not in 2022 if we use school uniforms to guess the time period. We can originate the first uniform from 1552 but have become very popular in the 19th century with sweet girls are forced to wear dresses and rough boys are forced to wear little businessman attire. Although these cloths have been a proud tradition Britain does not want to get rid of they have become overly expensive, are sexist and create classism.

The cost of the uniform cost around £100 per child which can be expensive for lower income family especially now with sky news stating: “One in 20 UK households are soon set to be unable to pay for their food and energy bills”, with uniforms being an necessity people are burden with so the child will not get bullied by his peers or expelled for wearing the wrong trousers Let us also not forgot how uniforms are different for each gender. This already sets it up as an antagonist for children who are not comfortable with their gender or don’t fit into the ‘norm’. With many girls, boys and teachers not understanding why girls are still not allowed to choose between wearing trousers or skirts but are rather (still) forced. Although some prefer the skirt most of them agree that they at least still have a choice. And why do some school uniforms have different blazers for each gender? Are we in a different decade or are we still accepting this old sexism as our legacy to pass on to our children? 

School uniform also create tribalism – especially between Privat and Public sector. And I think as a Glaswegian we have seen the extent this tribalism can become when we just look at the local football team, with parents filled with anxiety if they children walk home alone in the dark with a big target on them saying “I am different”. That is to say that they have benefits for security but many students that I know have been harassed because of their uniform.

2006 in Germany there was a debate about uniforms in Germany when two Muslim girls dressed in burkas arrived at a school in Bonn with them resulting in suspensions because it was seen as a political action. This created outrage and the education minister at that time supported mandatory school uniform but got put under heavy criticism with people comparing it to the Hitler youth, authoritarianism and militarism. It failed in the end and Germany still has no uniform. Yet many young people and parents in German I have spoken to are fond of school uniforms and so are many other people.  To say that school uniform are plain bad is a lie. They create a since of unity and belonging and can make everyone a little bit more equal socially. It also reduces the child anxiety what to wear every day and establishing an environment of studying. The advantages out way the disadvantages, but some traditional and modern schools of all sectors needed to change the uniform a decade ago but still haven’t. Even Germany have slowly started to test uniforms on a larger scale in private schools (like having a school sweatshirts) but not overstepping the children’s right for individuality. The LGTBQ+ community should not feel hostility from the environment where they learn, boys and girl should wear skirt or trousers (or kilts) if they want and not be forced. So at least when people look back at how our children dressed, they would say we lived in 2022 and not in the 20th century. 

By making them more affordable, creating uniform that are equal no matter what gender the child is and by giving students a little bit more choice we can make the classroom a smarter environment. Overall uniforms are a great thing, but they could be even better. Society has accepted, embraced and encouraged these movements so why aren’t our schools?
