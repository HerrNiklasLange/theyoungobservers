Hollywood has long held a reputation for actors behaving somewhat questionably. Both on and off set, some actors are so overwhelmed by their newfound fame and riches. For just one example, it is well documented that Jared Leto sent pig heads to the rest of the cast of The Suicide Squad and even sent a live rat to Margot Robbie; purely because he was living in character as ‘The Joker’. However, of all the A-list horror stories, very few manage to live up to the chaos that Ezra Miller has caused in recent months. 

Ezra Miller made his first appearance as The Flash in the 2016 Batman vs Superman film. Appearing further in the 2016 Suicide Squad and then more prominently in 2017’s Justice League. The DC superhero films have often struggled to maintain the same cast, most famously having recast Batman several times in the last 2 decades. Between the Dark Knight trilogy, The Justice League and The Batman (2022) they have recast just Batman from Christian Bale, to Ben Affleck to Robert Pattinson and then Michael Keaton, slated to appear as Batman in 2023. More noticeably, DC has struggled to sort out its creative direction. The Justice League was originally directed by Zack Snyder until the death of his daughter caused him to leave production late on. Jos Whedon took over and brought about lots of reshoots to change the tone of the film. The film was met with mostly negative reviews and did not perform well in the box office, so after lots of pressure from the public Snyder finished his original project and released The Justice League: Snyder Cut which was met far more positively. DC’s problems only continued from there. The highly publicised court case between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard brought a lot of scrutiny over Depp being fired from Pirates of The Caribbean but Heard being retained on the cast of DC’s Aquaman, even despite her losing the case and Depp proving she behaved abusively towards him. The Batman (2022) was received well however was soon followed by DC completely scrapping their $100 million Batgirl project. Whilst DC said it was not a reflection of actors’ talent and instead because they were moving in a different creative direction, the fact remains that it was a large-scale, expensive project that they simply decided to bin. However, one of DC’s few reliable actors who had performed well in box office hits had embarked on several public escapades in that time.

In April 2020, footage surfaced of Ezra Miller (who uses the pronouns they/them) grabbing a woman by the throat in an Icelandic bar. No charges were brought against him however it was just the start of a string of incidents. In March 2022 they were cited for obstructing a highway. Police described them as behaving ‘uncooperatively’. Not 9 days later, they were officially arrested for disorderly conduct and harassment after a widely reported incident where they shouted at and lunged at patrons of a karaoke bar in Hawaii. Furthermore, after posting bail they had a restraining order filed against them by a couple who they threatened to kill and even took a passport and wallet from. On April 19th they were once again arrested following another altercation involving them throwing a chair, leaving a half-inch cut on a 26-year-old’s forehead. Suitably, this incident occurred not long after their role in Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore hit the big screen, a franchise disrupted by the allegations made against lead actor Johnny Depp before he was taken off the movies’ roster prior to his successful court legal battles with Amber Heard. 

June 7th 2022 marked one of the strangest twists in the string of incidents. An Indigenous activist filed a protective order against Miller on behalf of their 12 year old child, who had allegedly been introduced to hallucinogenic drugs and flown around the world by Miller, showing similarities to the most well known event in the entire saga. Vermont State Police attended a farmhouse to try and remove three young children from the care of their mother and Ezra Miller due to firearms being left dangerously accessible to the youths. In less than a week, Miller found himself on the receiving end of two pieces of protective litigation put in place to protect young children from them. This could quite possibly have been what caused some difficult conversations to be had both with Miller and DC. On August 15th they released a statement saying they were seeking help on account of mental health issues and apologizing for their ‘past behaviour’. This reportedly came about after DC considered shelving the project due to the bad press it was generating with the actors’ name securely attached to Barry Allen’s alter ego. 

Since the drama has seemingly subsided, the film looks to be well on its way to success again. The Hollywood Reporter first reported that recent test screenings ahead of its summer 2023 release put it on par with, if not better than, Christopher Nolan’s critically acclaimed Dark Knight trilogy. Evidently, this would solve DC’s stale box office performances and put them back on track to creating a cinematic universe to rival Marvel. DC has poured over $200 million into The Flash and with audiences’ reactions being so positive, it’s easy to see why they’re trying to keep Miller as ‘golden’ as they can. Surely questions remain about how their violent and disruptive actions, though they only be in outbursts, have not been properly punished. Nevertheless, suitable treatment for legitimate mental health issues should mean Ezra Miller again becomes what they themself described as ‘productive’. But to a certain extent their past actions cannot define their future personality, only their choices can. Choosing to apologize to DC and seek help shows willingness to change, and bring to an end to the chaos they have caused over the past year, putting the minds of quite a few executives at ease.
