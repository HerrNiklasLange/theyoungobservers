Surrogacy is an arrangement, often supported by a legal agreement, whereby a woman (the gestational carrier) agrees to bear a child for another person or people, who will become the child's parent(s) after birth.

The 1970s saw the initial boom in the commercial surrogate industry - an industry has meant that women’s bodies can be exploited, legally. For years the industry has been awash with scandals, like the Baby M case, where the mother had her new born ripped out of her arms against her will to be given to the buyers, or when a Japanese millionaire bought 16 babies from a Thai clinic. Not to mention the Baby Gammy case, when in 2016 an Australian couple left a twin boy with his mother after they found out he had Down’s syndrome – the mother had no means to support him, she was to be the surrogate not the mother. Surrogacy has led to a total commodification of human life: choose the race and eye colour, complete a payment transaction, and nine months later, the baby is yours… if you still want it. Surrogacy can be an act of kindness from one human to the other in the form of altruistic surrogacy (where no monetary compensation is expected) where a woman can give people the happiness they crave from having a child, but behind it is an industry that buys and sells human life. Where babies are made to order for the world’s rich. Where the mothers rights and welfare, even her right to be called a ‘mum’ are discarded, all for the happiness and satisfaction of the consumer. 

The UK is not innocent. We are a country that allows surrogacy- in fact it is a practice recommended by the NHS when a couple or individual cannot conceive naturally. Yes, the NHS doesn’t explicitly mention commercial surrogacy as an option, but it also doesn’t condemn it. For many potential parents, commercial surrogacy is easier than if they were to do it altruistically: it doesn’t require them to bond with the surrogate or attend any medical appointments for example, making it very appealing. There is nothing appealing about surrogacy except from its price and ease, so should the NHS, an organisation dedicated to protecting human life, be taking more responsibility to stop people benefiting from women’s vulnerability and desperation?  

Thankfully, Sweden took on this responsibility, and after a 2016 Governmental Inquiry, banned all Surrogacy in the country. This was and is a monumental decision for the rights of women in Sweden and globally, it also set a precedent for other countries, especially for other Western Countries. There were objections to this ruling, mainly intended fathers, who felt that if a woman wants to be a surrogate, then surely it is wrong to stop her from doing so. However, the fact that very few women cried over the missed opportunity, does say a lot. The law has been criticised for its ban on altruistic surrogacy as many believe that because the mother is not being paid, then there is no exploitation. Perhaps she is doing it out of generosity- for a friend, daughter or sister. Nevertheless, the inquiry refutes this and states that there is no proof that legalising altruistic surrogacy would do away with exploitation. The inquiry came to this conclusion as they thought that even though a woman might make the decision herself, she might be fully supported or that the woman is not being taken advantage of, fundamentally the problem is women’s bodies are being bought and sold.

The waters of altruistic surrogacy can be very difficult to tread, but fundamentally a woman’s body is still being used for someone else’s gain. Having said that, it does allow same-sex couples or those who cannot conceive naturally the chance to raise a child of their own, and it means the mother knows the soon to be parents and can trust that they will be with her every step of the way. As great as this may sound, in reality the mother is still doing what is done commercially, but getting less for it. Pregnancy is a risk for any woman, but a risk that is usually worth taking as you will give birth to a child that you can watch grow and be part of its life. But with surrogacy that gift is not given to the mother.  The baby is still taken from her, to be raised by other parents. Yes, she may be praised as an angel, but her body is still being used as a vessel.  Yes, it could be argued that some women may be truly happy to become a surrogate mother for friends or family, the same way that people might donate a kidney or blood to a loved one, but surrogacy is not in the same ballpark. The bottom line is women’s bodies are being used. After nine months of pregnancy, having lasting health impacts both physically and mentally as well the risk of death, and after all that it is inhumane that the mother is not entitled to have the right to: one, be guaranteed a relationship with her child or two, the simple right of being called the mother of her child.  

However, altruistic surrogacy is a very small part of the problem. Women in the most desperate of situations are the ones who are really suffering. Pimped out by their husbands or tricked by gangs, the women are then pumped full of oestrogen and progesterone, at risk of fatal side effects, to produce as many babies as possible, one after the other.  These women’s bodies are left damaged, and they experience awful abuse in these clinics, often raped and assaulted. For many the prospect of making money is enough of a driving force to endure these atrocities. 

 The West, including the UK, has allowed its citizens to use baby farms for years. It is shocking to see how quickly the West has ignored the United Nations: Conventions of the Rights of the Child. The UK does not allow the sale of human bodies, but as long as we can see cute, happy babies with their new celebrity ‘parents’, surrogacy is perfectly fine. Once again it is the women who are the most vulnerable; those in the most desperate of circumstances that are exploited. In 2011, 14 Vietnamese women – half of them pregnant- were rescued from an illegal surrogate breeding ring in Thailand. The company, later to be named as the Baby 101 Clinic, was receiving orders by e-mail from parents to be, offering thousands of dollars per newborn. In some cases, for a discount, fathers to be could send over sperm to impregnate the surrogate, who was being held captive with her passport confiscated.  

The company charged £35,000 for the delivery of a baby, the women didn’t even get £1,500.  

The women are not there because they want to be; it’s because there is no other option for them. They are vulnerable. Helpless. Desperate. It’s the women who need the most help who are exploited. The countries who not only have the moral compass, but the means to do so, should be putting an end to this and save vulnerable women from exploitation.  

The only way women’s bodies can stop being exploited in surrogacy is if illegal companies and gangs aren’t given money. The only reason these clinics exist is because of the sheer amount of money that is pumped into them by the world’s rich. There are so many children in the UK who need and long for a home in a loving home. By helping the kids who are already alive, we can stop the exploitation of women’s bodies.
