“Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.”
― Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein.

The classic tale of Frankenstein's monster is a tale we heard again and again. Although the story is fiction, there is a new monster, but with the devilish twist: it tricked us thinking it is not real.
This story begins in a time of turbulence and change: the civil rights movement, the Vietnam war and the assassination of    J.F.K come to mind when thinking of the sixties. But in a small lab in MIT, a man comes up with an idea that would change life forever as we know it. The internet. MIT computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider dreams up of a global computer network. A decade later the first email has been sent. 1990, the world wide web is born. In 1995, Microsoft launches windows95, becoming the fixture for all the computers around the world. And now, with nearly everyone owning a small annoying computer in their pockets, we cannot escape it. But has this new monster of this era made us better off?
Most would say agree but increasing more and more people are starting to change their mind and are understanding what the internet has become: a rabbit hole. Some have gone as far as writing books on the dangers of the internet, for example a computer science professor from Georgetown University who proposes that we need a philosophy for the internet. And if a computer scientist writes a book warning us about the internet maybe we should take, a dive into this behemoth of the 21st century.


The rise of Facebook in the noughties was revolutionary. With a small simple feature, it made social media the power house it is today: the like button. Its influence can be felt everywhere from video services, social media, blogs as well as news outlets. And now? The world is slowly turning insane with all the self approval we need from strangers. Phones that have social media installed  have turned into gambling machines, that we carry around every single day. We look every 10 minutes, anxiously, at our screen to see how many likes we have received on our post and read every single comment like it is a holy script. But besides being addictive -which these services pro-actively try to master-, it sells a fictional reality of a 'perfect life', sending a wrong and absurd message to its users. It is a tool for harassment, online bullying and it disables you from engaging in more meaningful actions and relations. In Ryan Holiday book 'ego is the enemy' ,he ask the reader the question "to be or to do?", if you ever been on social media the majority of the post are to be. We rarely rewards hard work anymore and rather give the instant stimulation to selfies and/or 'hot people' posing in front of the camera, setting also a comically high beauty standard. We don't give merits to people that do the work, but because they don't get millions of like should they not do the work that is important? We need to give back merit where it should be given, do the work and not glorify our lives. Unless we want to live a life in delusion; of entitlement, paranoia, and control. This unhealthy culture only gets worse when we bring children into the equation, with a 2018 study stating that 9 in 11 children between the ages 13-18 are using social media. It is very possible that number has been amplified when we add the current pandemic and the lockdown. With Facebook itself being forced to Congress (again), to address a whistleblower, who who released tens of thousands of pages of internal research and documents indicating the company was aware of various problems caused by its apps, including Instagram's potential "toxic" effect on teen girls.


The internet has made life easier but is easier always better? It is for many criminals who can to steal your identity or make you lose a vast amount of money. Foreign governments are getting data from companies like Google and other firms like social media to undermine free elections in Democratic countries by targeting voters of their respective country. With Google itself stated that "we have found some evidence of efforts to misuse our platforms during the 2016 U.S. election by actors linked to the Internet Research Agency in Russia. ". We also saw this in Britain with the Brexit referendum. The fuel of false claims by the Brexit campaign and media like twitter that allows everyone to send out a message without any fact-checks, resorts in a wildfire. The Reuters Institute's Digital news report found that in 2016 social medias, both served as a source of information for around 35% of UK's public, which is worst case 22.61 million British voters who entrusted twitter as a reliable source for information. Because of these fact we cannot deny the impact social media has in elections and even in day to day life. But let's take a break from politics. Let's say a girl named Lisa spend 3 hours a day on social media, YouTube or other media sites on her phone, that is 21 hours a week, 84 hours a month and nearly 1096 hours a year - over 45 and a half days - she would be spending on her device: scrolling through the void that we call the internet. These three hours a day in a year is about all of January and half of February, which is a less than the UK average.  But there is a way out of this rabbit hole.
Let us return to the Computing professor in Georgetown. His name is Cal Newport and he wrote the book 'digital minimalism' amongst others.  He is a interesting person: he goes everyday on long walks; reads the news paper at the end of the day and he does never checks his emails outside of work. He is the opposite of what one would expect. With the knowledge of these powerful machines he also knows how we can reap the benefits of the internet without getting enchanted by its charm. His philosophy proposes to spend a full month limiting technology to just the basic necessity. Then after a month, revaluate and look how you can re-introduce technology in your life and ask yourself 'Do I really need this?' and if the answer is no then let it rest in peace. If you are scared that you make yourself unavailable, don't. If people know that you are unavailable from a certain time period, most will respect your choice. But if it is truly important they will find a way to you.
This 'de-digitalisation', takes away the instant stimulation we crave. Using the human laziness to our advantage, we can add a couple of obstacles like unplugging the TV after we are done watching telly, deleting social media from our phones while still allowing access on the computer to its content and deleting video games after a session. By making things less convenient, we are establishing a less noise world in that we can focus in. We should not stop fully using these wonderful instruments but rather break free from our urges, re-establish our values and put the spotlight back on things like family, friends, education, career, your pet(s) or whatever it is you have a deep interest in. With the little time we have left in this Universe why not life it to the fullest? For that to happen though we must look at the way we're using technology and take the first step, the courage, the will to go forward into a new chapter of our lives. As Ferris Bueller said himself "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.".


In the original story Frankenstein's monster, the monster has both attributes of a protagonist and antagonist, so does the internet. They both are a tool of good and evil, a weapon and a life saver, they are beloved and despised. But the internet is not alive (at least not yet), we have still a chance to stop the tragedy this modern monster. If we only think on how we use the internet as a 'tool' instead giving in to our urges and limit use of it a short time period. Maybe we don't need to grab pitch forks and torches in the end.
