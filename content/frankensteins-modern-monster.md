“Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.”
― Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein.

The classic tale of Frankenstein's monster is a tale we hear again and again. Although the story is fiction; there is a new monster with a devilish twist. 
Once upon a time in the 60s and idea is created that twisted the world into the shape that we know it as: the internet. Soon the first email has been sent. 1990, the world wide web is born and in 1995, Microsoft launches windows95, becoming the fixture for all the computers around the world. And now, with nearly everyone carrying a small, annoying, computer in their pockets, we cannot escape it. But has this new monster of this era made us better off?
Most love it and few hate it, but increasingly more and more of us are starting to change our mind and are beginning to understand just what the internet has become: a rabbit hole. Some have gone as far as writing books on the dangers of the internet, for example, a computer science professor from Georgetown University who proposes that we need a philosophy for how we approach the internet. So, if a computer scientist writes a book warning us about the internet, we need delve into this behemoth of the 21st century.

The rise of Facebook in the noughties was revolutionary. With a small simple feature, it made social media the powerhouse it is today: the like button. Its influence can be felt everywhere from video services, social media, blogs as well as news outlets. And now? The world is slowly turning insane with all the self approval we need from strangers.
Phones are practical but are also unbeneficial;  text messages, emails and social media let you get in contact with everyone around the world and have turned our devices into gambling machines that we use all day every day. We look every 10 minutes, anxiously, at our screen to see how many likes we have received on our post and read every single comment like it is a holy script. This addiction (which these services pro-actively try to master) distract us from the important things and sells a fictional reality of a 'perfect life' , sending a wrong and absurd message to its users and the children that are using these services.

Good or Bad one cannot deny the unimaginable of scale harassment, online bullying and shaming, limiting its consumers and yet also giving them unlimited access to everything. "to be or to do?", if you have ever been on the internet many are ‘to be’; to be a fake version of yourself - especially on social media. And the craziest thing of all is how we give each other likes for little and meaningless things. Did Stephen Hawking have a Twitter account where he posted all his thought, no. He did the work. He was a grounded human being who did not live a in a bubble of self-delusion, entitlement and arrogance; in which so many people are trapped, he chose to do and he was not consumed by the black hole.
This unhealthy culture only gets worse when we bring children into the equation, with a 2018 study stating that 9 in 11 children between the ages 13-18 are using social media. It is very possible that this number has been amplified when we add the current pandemic and the lockdown. At least big business are responsible and care for its user, especially its young ones and would never exploit them for profit. Right? Facebook (now meta) has been again and again dragged in front of Congress with the newest being to address a whistle-blower, who released tens of thousands of pages of internal research and documents indicating the company was aware of various problems caused by its apps, including Instagram's potential "toxic" effect on teen girls. This is not to say that there are some people that have a soul in this industry but it is hard to find them.

The internet has made life easier but is easier always better? It is for many criminals who can steal your identity or make you lose a vast amount of money. Foreign governments are obtaining data from companies like Google and other firms like social media to undermine free elections in Democratic countries. With Google itself has stated that: "we have found some evidence of efforts to misuse our platforms during the 2016 U.S. election by actors linked to the Internet Research Agency in Russia. ", Russian campaigns to spread their propaganda to destabilize the west and spreading idiotic claims that the Russian Invasion of Ukraine is actually not an invasion just a peaceful military operation, is just the tip of the iceberg.

But let's take a break from politics. Let's say a girl named Lisa spend 3 hours a day on: social media, YouTube or other media sites on her phone. That is: 21 hours a week, 84 hours a month and nearly 1096 hours a year - over 45 and a half days - she would be spending on her device. Scrolling through the void. These three hours a day in a year is about all of January and half of February; still less  than the UK average. Although she could be spending her time on the phone learning new skills but that does not seem likely especially for this generation. After all this said is there a way to harvests the knowledge from the internet - like originally intended -  without getting hooked on it?
The professor mentioned at the beginning was Cal Newport, who wrote the book 'Digital Minimalism' amongst others. He has a very different and healthier relationship with technology than many of us have. Due to his work, he knows how we can reap the benefits of the internet without getting enchanted by its spell. His philosophy proposes to spend a full month limiting technology to just the necessity. After a month of doing this, he suggests to revaluate and look how you can re-introduce technology in your life and ask yourself 'Do I really need this?' and if the answer is ‘No’ then don’t allow it to return into our lives. Many people would be scared that they would be missing out but to that he says; don't. If people know that you are unavailable from a certain time period, most will respect your choice. If it is truly important, it will find a way to you.

This ‘de-digitalisation’ takes away the instant stimulation we crave so desperately, but by making things less convenient, we are establishing a less noisy world in that we can focus in without getting ten notifications. We should not stop fully using these wonderful instruments, but rather break free from our urges, re-establish our values and put the spotlight back on things like family, friends, education, career, your pet(s) or whatever it is you have a deep interest in. By adding small obstacles we can aspire to become the best version of ourselves by deleting social media from your phone or turning of the notifications as an example. With the little time we have left in this world, technology should not control our life, but we should control our own.

In the original story of Shelley's Frankenstein's, the monster has both attributes of a protagonist and antagonist, as does the internet. They are a tool both of good and evil, a weapon and a life saver, beloved and despised. But the internet is not alive (at least not yet), we have still a chance to stop the tragedy this modern monster. If we only think on how we use the internet as a 'tool' instead giving in to our urges and limit use of it a short time period. Maybe we don't need to grab pitch forks and torches in the end.
