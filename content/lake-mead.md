The 19th of July, 2022, saw the highest ever recorded temperatures across Britain. In not the first of many instances, climate change (or global warming) reared its head and caused chaos across the country. Peak July temperatures between 1991 and 2020 in London average just less than 23 degrees Celsius, yet temperatures capped at 40.2 degrees Celsius on the 19th. Across the south, civilian and even military transport systems struggled to cope as runways and train lines melted, but for our friends ‘across the pond’ are discovering much more than how unsuitable their infrastructure is for rising temperatures.

Las Vegas is well known for being in a desert and relies on nearby Lake Mead to provide its water. Vegas also has a rather rich history, its birth and success known to be certainly helped by mafias seeing easy opportunities to make money. With casinos, they didn’t even need to rig the games, most slot machines and card games are already designed so the house always wins. However some of this success comes at a cost, through dubious means.

On the afternoon of Saturday 7th of May, walkers on the edge of the Lake spotted what appeared to be an old industrial storage drum. Peering inside, its contents became quickly apparent. National Park Rangers later confirmed their findings. The body, though mostly decomposed, is still clad in a discount store shirt, belt and shoes; all which helped to identify the era in which the body was from. The person was determined to have died from a gunshot wound (possibly to the head, though not officially verified), stuffed into the barrel and taken several hundred yards out into the Lake before being dumped into what was historically very deep water. Due to over-use of resources by the 40 million residents of Las Vegas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming who rely on the lake and droughts from excessive heat, the water levels have dropped in the past few decades such that what was murky depths, is now the present-day surface; buried history is now a modern mystery. 

Authorities are under no pretences about the situation this discovery has put them in. Homicide detective Lieutenant Ray Spencer said ‘there is a very good chance as the water level drops that we are going to find additional human remains’ and confirmed to the New York Times that investigators are considering the possibility that the death is mafia-related. Unfortunately he has been proven right all too quickly. Not a week later, Park Rangers received yet another report that skeletal remains had been found. Despite not being found in any particularly suspicious circumstances (like a barrel for example) the fact remains that bodies are turning up at a noticeable rate which has attracted the attention of local sleuths, looking to identify the victims themselves. The Daily Mail also reports that a torso section of skeleton has since been found too, however it is not part of a full skeleton and has not yet been widely reported or verified.

Fox5 Las Vegas is reporting that two local retired Police Officers, David Kohlmeier and Daniel Minor, are offering a lump sum reward of $5,000 to divers, or anyone else, who finds more bodies. The two are part of The Problem Solver Show and are seeking professional divers to assist law enforcement in their efforts to bring closure to families and solve any relevant missing persons cases from the time. Their work may soon not even involve divers, water levels are at lowest in 1,200 years and after the Federal government declared a water shortage last August, water rationing is in effect to stop Lake Mead running entirely dry. From May 1st to August 31st, restrictions are in place to stop residents from using sprinklers and other ‘landscape watering’ devices between 11 am and 7 pm, similar to the ‘hosepipe ban’ currently in place in the south of England. Lt Spencer made it clear that it’s not unusual for one or two bodies to appear annually, however the unprecedented low levels of water are accelerating this process of discovery. 

Climate change remains ever relevant, appearing in the news at least once a day. From wildfires to historic temperatures, it’s easy to pretend that the effects can only be seen abroad however it was recently found that the recent record-breaking heatwave across Britain was made 10x more likely due to the effects of greenhouse gases released from industry and historical data suggested even if the heatwave had occurred, it would have been at least 2 degrees cooler without the effects of global warming. World leaders are taking steps to reduce our carbon emissions, it is still written into UK law that we have the target to be carbon neutral by 2050 and we remain a signatory of the Paris Climate Accord, but evidently the threat is far more imminent than we prepared for. So the big question I find myself asking after researching what’s happening in Vegas is this: when the Clyde and the Thames start running dry, what will we find?
