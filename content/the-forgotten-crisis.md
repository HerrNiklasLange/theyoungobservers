War. It never changes. And now after World War two Europe and the west is reminded that times of peace are over and the world is entering a new area. Only the future can tell what this is but we can see shifts in policy across Europe with increases in defends budgets, most notable Germany spending 100 billion Euros into the military, meeting NATO defence budget pledges. 

This significant change in policy can also been seen in the energy sector: with western governments scrambling to gain energy independence from Russia, this might sound good but it comes at a grave cost; the cost of the environment.

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres (pictured above) told attendees of the Economist Sustainability Summit: "The 1.5-degree goal is on life support. It is in intensive care.”, this is coming after last year Cop26 meeting in Glasgow Scotland, with world leaders failing to agree on decisive arrangement to stop the worst of global warming - a big reason can be traced back to Australia lobbying against any crucial actions. 

If policy does not change we will fail in a abhorrent way with mortifying consequences. To keep that threshold alive, carbon output needs to be cut in half by the end of this decade. Instead, as Mr Guterres points out, emissions are set to rise by 14%. Mr Guterres also talks about how the need for energy security cannot be brought by on fossil fuel and coal.

 "Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use,"


"This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.",


Coal also must be banished, Mr Guterres says, with a full phase-out for richer nations by 2030, and 2040 for all others, including China.

Coal "is a stupid investment," according to the Secretary General, "leading to billions in stranded assets.", with the Ukrainians bravely defending their freedom. The world must defend their environment; with the biggest responsibilities going to the G20 member -including Britain.

 But the climate crises seems to have been overshadowed by a war, resulting the enviroment being disregarded. It is only a matter of time before this ignorance will catch up with the world but: at what cost?
