For many decades, computers progressively moved away from their bulky prototypes, adapting in favour of users being able to intuitively make their way around an operating system without needing a PhD in computer science and 10 years experience. But, whilst the general population were revelling in new technology such as the first iPhone and other hand-held devices, a programmer (or group of programmers) under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto set off the chain reaction that led to the arrest of the rapper who called herself 'Genghis Khan with more pizzazz'.  

 

Bitcoin is widely considered to be the first cryptocurrency set up, all the way back in 2009, and as such is still considered one of the most influential. Cryptocurrencies are decentralised (not connected to any major banks/countries/governments) and gains value via confidence from investors. Rather like stocks in companies, it’s quite easy to invest in cryptocurrencies. Pick a platform (like Binance or Luno), pick a currency (there are thousands upon thousands to choose from, not all as successful as Bitcoin or Ethereum) and hit buy!  Also very similarly to stocks, the price/value of a cryptocurrency fluctuates depending on current affairs and levels of investment. Unfortunately, despite being free from any regulations (because it is decentralised it cannot be regulated by any individual company or government) it is still vulnerable to the issues and scams related to company stocks. There have been many ‘pump and dump’ schemes set up, in which hundreds of people invest large sums of money to increase its’ value and then quickly sell it all to make a nice profit whilst others (not in on the plan) are left with nothing but worthless currency. Even worse than this, sometimes the currencies themselves are just an elaborate scam in which the original creators simply disappear with all the money invested. One of the most famous examples of this is the ‘Squid’ currency that was supposedly meant to be integrated into a game inspired by the hit Netflix series ‘Squid Game’. Investors bought the currency after being promised the companion game that would allow them to play as a character in the various challenges seen in the TV show and also spend the currency in-game. Unfortunately, after the value of Squid increased from a cent to $2,800 per coin in less than a week, the anonymous creators ran off with (what is believed to be) at least $3.4 million. This served as a difficult lesson for young investors looking to ‘ride the wave’ and make a profit from their investment and has been widely circulated in the media as an example of how dangerous cryptocurrencies can be and how dishonest their creators can be.  

 

This week Razzlekhan, real name Heather Morgan, and her partner, Ilya Lichtenstein, have been implicated in the theft and subsequent laundering of Bitcoin from the hacking of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex in 2016. The couple allegedly handled the cleaning and rather lavish spending of 119,754 Bitcoins. When the original attack happened in 2016 this was worth a 'mere' £52 million, but with the sudden and exponential rise in many cryptocurrencys’ worth, it's now worth over £3.7 billion. Investigators from the US district of Columbia sought, and gained, a special warrant to access files of Mr Lichtenstein’s that contained an address and access codes for the cryptocurrency wallet the stolen funds were kept in. This allowed them to trace transactions in which the couple had cashed out over £624 million into: gold, Walmart gift cards and non-fungible tokens. For now these crimes remain only allegations, they are yet to fight their case in court and I would never believe that they pulled of the hack on their own, so it is important to remember that ultimately the team behind their illicit activities will likely be held most accountable for any crimes committed. However it would appear to be a very difficult case for the couple to win as authorities have a strong paper-trail leading right to the very wallet the funds are still in. Due to the nature of blockchain technology (the basis on which cryptocurrencies operate), all transactions are verified and stored by computers all around the world, thus once authorities had the address of their wallet and proof it was theirs, thousands of computers all around the world have provided the damning evidence they needed. Unfortunately, what separates these two from the afore mentioned scammers is that they didn’t steal from many people all around the world, or anonymously set up a ‘pump and dump’ scheme to make a few million, they specifically targeted a cryptocurrency exchange to steal their company funds and then stored that in cryptocurrency. Sadly for them, it didn’t pan out as expected. 

 

Although this seemingly represents the end of the line for the alleged thieves, it's just the beginning for all the wannabe hackers and ransomware attackers around the globe. Some of the most major ransomware attacks (where a company's' software or data is encrypted/deleted unless a ransom is paid) in recent years have often involved paying the ransom by cryptocurrencies as attackers believe it is untraceable. The amazing work of this investigative team has shown that once perpetrator(s) are identified, it is indeed very traceable and therefore have sent a powerful message to those who think they can get away with keeping illegal funds hidden in cryptocurrencies; you are not as untouchable as you think.
