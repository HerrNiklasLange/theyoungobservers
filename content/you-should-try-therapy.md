Mental health has so much prevalence nowadays that sometimes it’s hard to think about what we should do it about on our own. Everyone has seen mental health pages on Instagram, usually only after scrolling for an unhealthy amount, they see a post and immediately they like it and move on without taking those ideas into mind. Maybe it might seem silly as it’s just an Instagram post, but the idea of therapy should be considered by everyone at least once. A bit of self-care has never hurt anyone, and why not get professional help for some self-care techniques? 

Therapy can help with many different problems that we suffer through our daily lives. Mental health is what therapy is all about. It was commonly disregarded by many until people realised it was just as real, painful and damaging as physical wounds. Many people have misconceptions about what certain diagnoses mean but it’s just a stigma. Lots of people have been opposing this stigma by normalising it but mental health but is still basically just linked with suicide when there’s a whole spectrum of problems. Therapy is associated with weakness which makes men who want to go feel very emasculated, this is from toxic masculinity where men are not allowed to talk about their feelings, when in reality going to therapy is the courageous thing to do. You should be proud for seeking help and wanting a healthier lifestyle.

Lots of us suffer from anxiety, we all worry about: work, school or our social lives. It makes our hands sweaty, our breath shaky or even make us feel sick. When you start feeling anxious sometimes our worries are blown out of proportion and can interfere with everyday lives and relationships, this can very easily overwhelm all of us. There are great techniques used to help cope with this anxiety from breathing techniques to simply removing yourself from the situation [1]. With therapy you can get help with this anxiety, no longer will it cause you any distress or harm. 
Therapy can also give you room to express yourself. When talking to a therapist, you really don’t have to worry about any judgement being cast upon you. It’s a way to find out more about yourself in a safe environment. We usually have anxieties about what people will think about us but with therapy you can practice anything. Find it difficult talking to people? Try having a conversation with your therapist. Find yourself frustrated and not voicing your opinions? You can practice expressing yourself. These issues that used to affect your daily life, no longer have any power in the real world. There’s always something to gain from attending therapy and there’s no harm in going. 
Depression is a heavy subject, I’m sure we’ve all had experiences seeing or talking to someone suffering from depression. Sometimes we can’t help, listening may not be enough or they might even be scared to share their thoughts. When talking to a trained specialist, with complete confidentiality, the hardest part of the talk will be taking the first step. After you’ve taken the first step, you feel so relieved, no one outside of them will know anyone of this. Therapy can often show a different perspective on your situation to try and help you cope. Therapy can provide you with techniques to avoid self-harm with immediate coping mechanisms. Therapy doesn’t just help you on that day, but it provides life long essential skills. 



Unfortunately, in the recent years eating disorders have become more and more common. With this increased commonality therapists have become well versed and familiar with these various disorders. The therapists help by establishing a healthy eating and drinking routine tailored to that person needs and life at home. Everyone has a routine in the morning with lots of habits, not all of these habits can be healthy – procrastination as a big one – and these new routines can help establish healthy habits. Input from occupational therapists makes it easier for the person to live their life and do daily everyday tasks without being stressed or anxious. 

I’ve recently asked someone recovering from anorexia how they felt after therapy sessions :
“ when I came out of a therapy session, I felt a relief because I felt more understood” they also followed up with  

“lots of people say they feel this way after therapy, or from the input of other mental health services. It really shows the positive impact therapy has on people”.

For people curious how it works: The therapists working with people can provide further help if needed from eating disorder clinics with specialised therapists. These therapists understand even more and can track the persons physical state , this is very important to do as some people may need to go to hospital if they are in danger . By having specialised therapists this makes sure the person in need of help Is not in any danger and, supports the person even in rehab. Therapy can provide constant care for the person , if they are an inpatient or an outpatient . This means that even when people are in a mental hospital, they are still getting therapy sessions to help with their thoughts while their physical state is getting taken care of. 

Support hotlines can help a person with many different issues and are vital in keeping a person safe and secure. These hotlines can be called, texted or emailed at any time of the day. The services are equipped with trained therapists to help the person and calm them down for the most extreme cases. For example, someone could be stressed out about a family problem or a relationship problem and the therapists at the other end will know exactly what to say and do to benefit the person.

“texts and calls are completely confidential unless the person is a harm to themselves or others”- this opens up a lot of other doorways for people as many especially boys are embarrassed about their issues but won’t go to therapy about it, it’s a great first step. With the help of hotlines, thankfully, suicide rates decreased. Help hotlines can help you with a wide range of issues
If you are struggling in any way or just want to see the benefits of therapy, give it try. Therapists are here to benefit you. They have a wide range of knowledge and contacts to help you with any problem. From something as severe as an eating disorder to just giving you a comfortable place to vent about your day. They’ll comfort you and give you a fresh perspective on your situation. Therapy will give you life long techniques that will help you for every type of situation. There’s always something to gain from therapy, you should try going at least once.
