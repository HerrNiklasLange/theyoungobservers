From the UK, to Iran, round to Sri Lanka or 
across the pond to the USA, people power is on 
the frontpage of nearly every newspaper. 
Governments have collapsed, leaders have 
resigned and all over the world the people have 
spoken. Whether it is about fair pay, civil rights, 
rampant inflation, recessions and cost of living 
or a combination of it all, action has been taken.

In the UK there has been on-going strikes over 
rail staff and their pay, alongside the chaos of 
Boris Johnson’s resignation and the many scandals that have caused uproar throughout his 
tenure, from partygate to the lavish decorations of downing street. In Iran there have been 
protests over the loss of the 2nd largest salt lake in the world which is located in the country, 
and the collapse of the countries tourism industry as a result of it. America faces protests for 
virtually every issue you can think of, from women standing up for their rights to govern their 
own body and have an abortion in the face of Roe v Wade being overturned. And finally –
Sri Lanka – the focus of this post, from human rights violations to corruption, the chaos in Sri 
Lanka is a warning that we can’t ignore.

Discrimination, soaring food and fuel prices, 
collapse of transport services, leaders 
resigning, police brutality, forced 
deportation, colonisation. Take a guess at 
what country this describes. 
This is what happens when people are 
ignored and lied to by their government. 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa (known by the locals as ‘Gota’), was the president of Sri Lanka, he has 
been chased out of his role and the country as the island nation has come together in mass 
protests, mainly concentrated in the capital Columbo. The protests come after inflation in the 
country hit staggering amounts with their inflation rate at 55% in June and food prices rising
by 80% and transport costs by 128% as reported by reuters. *1
the following the oil and wheat 
shortages created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, the problems don’t just start 
and stop there, the president has been subject to scrutiny for well over a decade. He was the 
defence secretary back in 2009, at the end of the brutal civil war that had been fought since 
1983. Rajapaksa was condemmed by the international community as he was seen as 
responsible for the human rights abuses carried out against the Tamil people during and 
following the war, with the number Tamil civilians being killed in the Tamil genocide being 
estimated to be between 40,000-70,000, with some estimated placing it even higher . While

the Sinhalese people, the largest ethnic 
group on the island, supported him for some 
time, electing him as president in 2019, his 
popularity has since dwindled as the memory 
of victory fades and has been replaced more 
and more by failure. Whether it be because 
of his refusal to reach out and repair the 
relationship with the Tamil people, or his 
anti-muslim policies that were forced upon 
everyone in the country during the COVID-19 crisis (forcing all bodies to be cremated, 
something which goes against the rules of Islam) or the financial mismanagement of his 
government. From somewhat pointless ‘infrastructure’ projects which had millions pumped 
into them, most of which ended up in the pockets of only the richest in the country, to the 
nationalisation of the Audit Office and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery 
or Corruption (and you thought politicians tried to be sneaky with their corruption….). To 
add to the list of issues, taxes to the wealthy were slashed, wealthy companies were given 
extended tax holidays despite the country already lacking in tax revenue, Gota essentially 
created a closed economy by introducing import restrictions and crippling the countries main 
export industry – agriculture – by banning chemical fertilizer and on top of all of that,
defence spending jumped to higher levels than during the civil war. Debt had been piling up 
ever since foreign direct investment and international loans flooded into the country when 
peace was declared, and unsurprisingly this debt continued to increase. According to Foreign 
Policy (FP) *2
, the government claimed that this was ‘manageable’ and they were on track to 
paying off the $29 million within 5 years. This was far from the truth.
Here we are – July of 2022. The government has collapsed. Schools have been shut for 
weeks. People are queueing for fuel and shops are rationing milk. The nations hospitals can’t 
cope with the BBC reporting on shortages of medical drugs, anaesthetic drugs, implants and 
suture materials.*3 The president has fled to Singapore. The fate of the country remains 
unknown, and that is just as bad as knowing its going badly. 
With the UK’s Prime Minister also fleeing his role after food and fuel prices soar, we must 
see the other similarities we have with Sri Lanka, and make sure we don’t follow them into 
the unknown. Whoever becomes Prime Minister next will have to act quickly and at least get 
inflation under control, then there’s the contentious issues of discrimination, nationalism and 
immigration, a recovery from COVID and the problems caused by the war in Ukraine, all 
problems that Sri Lanka failed to address. We may not be at the same stage as Sri Lanka but I 
wouldn’t want to risk getting any closer.
