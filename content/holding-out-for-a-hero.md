As most of Europe slept on the 24th of February, just before 6 a.m. (Moscow Time), Social media exploded at the same moment the first missiles did. War. Across the world, people would be flooded with images, videos and messages depicting the anguish of the Ukrainian people. Within the first two days of the war, the Ukrainian people and their supporters could rally around both a leader, President Zelensky, and a mysterious fighter, “The Ghost of Kyiv”. 24 days on, Ukraine holds.

Description automatically generatedHeroes are something virtually all tacticians ignore, but a factor in war, and in life, that should never be glossed over. Churchill inspiring the British people during the Battle of Britain, as London, and other cities across Britain were being bombed in wave after wave of German raids over the country is what comes to mind for me when thinking about a wartime leader. The ability to keep a country together, building the willpower that led to people dragging desks out of the rubble of their destroyed offices and continuing with their paperwork, is something that Hitler wasn’t planning on. Flash forward to the modern-day and we see Volodymyr Zelensky, wartime leader of Ukraine who has famously told the US that he needs “ammunition, not a ride” in response to their offer of extracting him from war-torn Kyiv. In response to his frontline leadership, his popularity surged amongst Ukrainians with over 90% of his people supporting him. His approval rating had tripled from just 31% of Ukrainians supporting him in December of 2021 according to a poll from the Ratings Sociological Group. He is now the face of the fight against Russia and the fight for freedom. 

 

Tripling your approval rating in less than three months is virtually unheard of, but it shines a light on how much we, as humans, need heroes. Some inspire us to be the best version of ourselves, others inspire over a hundred thousand ex-pats to return to fight for their countries’ freedom, but no matter what type of hero we find, we love the ideas, the myths and the stories they create – that’s where the Ghost of Kyiv comes into.

In the opening 30 hours of the war stories started to emerge online about a mysterious fighter pilot, given the nickname “The Ghost of Kyiv”, who was said to have shot down 6 enemy fighters during the Kyiv offensive. Videos, pictures and news reports started to come out covering the mysterious hero, the problem is that many of these images and videos were fakes. Tribute videos using a video game were misinterpreted as real-life footage, images were doctored to change flags, emblems and dates to make them seem Ukrainian and nobody could find out if one fighter pilot had actually shot down all 6 of the Russians. 

 When we found out about the fakes, his story only became more popular, with more and more tributes, reports and discussions occurring across the world. The fact that it couldn’t really be seen who the pilot of this MIG-29, that so many Kyiv locals had reported seeing, really was just added to his name – he was a ghost after all. 

 

We may never know if he is real, but the impact ‘he’ has had on the people of Ukraine and their supporters across the world is immense. While the likelihood of the first fighter ace since World War Two arising in the first two days of a war, from an air force with only 98 fighting planes is next to none, that’s not what people need to hear right now. People need a hero to look to when faced with the horrific destruction of their homes and families. The Ghost of Kyiv can symbolise not only the other heroes who are fighting off the Russian advances but also the belief that their aggressive and unlawful neighbour can be defeated through the bravery of individuals. As Jared Keller summarised in his report for Task & Purpose –“ I want to believe — and I know I’m not the only one.”
