Here in the UK the news, and virtually every other form of communication and media, has been dominated by one event. The death of Queen Elizabeth II. 70 years of reign, understandably the nation has been rattled, she was beloved  by huge swathes of the nation nay, the world. Everyone knew she was old, but honestly I was still surprised when she passed.  One thing that nobody is surprised by however is that her death has brought about a lot of patriotic posturing: parades of guns, horses and soldiers, grand ceremonies with gold and silver ornaments, and of course constant reminders of Britain’s ‘great’ past, and the royal’s role in this past.

The juxtaposition between the wealth and decadence of the Queen and her processions and the strikes and protests of the previous few weeks leaves a sour taste in my mouth. It has been announced that on Monday, the day of the funeral, food banks would close. The day the queen passed virtually all strikes were called off. Yet the cost of living continues to increase rapidly and the cost of the Queen’s death also seems to keep rising with the economic times estimating that the expenses related to her death and Charles’ coronation will reach £6 billion, with even more money expected to be spent on “organisational changes”. Six billion pounds to be spent while on the same day food banks close, if that doesn’t sum up Britain’s class divide, I don’t know what would. The Queen, and the royal family, continue to be figureheads of the class divide in Britain, they are the physical embodiments of wealth in a time where millions are expected to struggle to stay warm this winter, how can the costs be justified, is it not royal duty to care for their subjects? What could £6 billion do for the people of Britain? Charlotte Proudman, a barrister specialising in violence against women and girls has been quoted by the Guardian as saying “We should use state money to fund an underfunded justice system, to support the homeless and those who can’t eat or heat their homes, not millions on a state funeral of a monarch who was not democratically elected” and it really is that simple, the people’s tax money is being used to help those who have more money than virtually anyone can ever even imagine while those who pay the taxes are left alone in uncertain and scary times.

Another controversial of the Queen’s life that has been celebrated (or at least ignored) over the past week has been the empire. We have already seen the royals and the wealthy benefit from the struggles of the working class, whether it’s the crown jewels that originate from virtually every country but Britain, the oppression that was imposed upon colonies and the wealth that came to Britain as a result of it. As a modern example, in March of this year, heir to the throne Prince William and his wife Princess Kate were  due to visit a cocoa farm in Belize. They had to cancel the visit as a local protest broke out over the royals plans to land their helicopter on a local football pitch. The protest wasn’t just over the use of the football pitch but it was part of a larger land dispute against Flora and Fauna International (a charity William is a patron of), the locals claim that the area controlled by the charity, including the football pitch is in fact their “communal ancestral land” that was “lost in the colonial era” with one local saying that “the monarchy’s a relic. We should leave it behind, it’s time for us to move forward”. This is a common theme with the royal family and the empire – crimes committed long ago that still haunt the victims still not being addressed. Just have a look in The British Museum, or indeed when the Queen passes Buckingham Palace one last time, have a look at the crown on her coffin and try to figure out if the jewels on it were from somewhere like Sheffield or somewhere like Andhra Pradesh.

It is clear that the damage sanctioned and encouraged by the royal family remains and will continue to remain long after Monday’s funeral, so once the nation has celebrated in the decadent, extravagant way we always do, what will we saw when we need to ask “is it all actually worth it?” With the vast majority of Britain only remembering Queen Elizabeth as the monarch, will her death mean time up for the remnants of the empire, or even the monarchy in Britain? For the former, I think winter will make more people say it wasn’t, times are already tough and they’re only going to get tougher, and for the latter, well, the empire is already fading with Barbados ending the Queens rule over the small island earlier in the year, and for the monarchy, I’d say if one fades so too does the other. It may be time up for the royals.
