Last week has been a grim reminder that with all the other crisis, like Corona, fuel and cost of living, we still need to deal with the biggest of them all; Global warming.

Record heat across the UK hitting new records of 40.1C, breaking the recent record holder of 2019 which was only 38.7C.
The heatwave across Europe has cost over 1,500 deaths *1, France spends nearly a billion Euros to fight the fires blazing through its country *2 (spending 850 million euros alone on upgrading its air fleet), and Greece asking retired firefighters to return to work to help fight the 50-70 daily wildfires. Images from a dystopian nightmare of forest burning down in the masses are a regular sight now. It was Australia 2019; it was California 2020 and 2021, now it is Europe’s turn to deal with its biggest wildfires in nearly half a century. This Russian roulette of wildfires will only get worse as we miss our targets over and over again that we set ourselves.

Even climate denialist cannot deny the reality we live in anymore, although their arguments has shifted from ‘climate change does not exist’, to ‘climate change exist but we have bigger crises’, but with more and more heatwaves becoming regular and water getting scarcer in countries that are struggling with the heatwave, like Italy and Portugal restricting drinking water access *3 and in addition seeing the failures of the COP26 and the most recent Berlin climate security conference, the question now is: how long will it take until we do significant action? How many droughts can we take until we change? How much more scientific research do we need to tell us this cannot go on? How many Fridays for future protest we need for new green policies? How many deaths through the heat do need to happen, that we realize that sacrifices must be made? How many lively villages need to be burned to ashes to stop government investing in fossil fuel? How many rivers, lake and ground water supply need to dry up until we have regulation to stop wasteful use of water in sectors like agriculture (which accounts for 70% of water use worldwide)?

The norm we have know will not return and it is a fantasy expect it to return. As depressing this is for young people like me to realize this. The question now is for Britain and the world simply this: What is more important: Cheap food, cheap fuel, or our existence on this planet that we call home?  Climate change is an existential threat to humanity, yet we are unable to give up on our privileges and conveniences to reduce our environmental damage. Government needs to step up and put in restrictions and encourage reducing our fuel, meat and invest in renewable energy sector (another benefit would be new jobs as well and less reliance on foreign energy), this will not be always popular, but it is needed to stop the worst to stop the doomsday Glock we have started
