If you’re a social media user, the chances are you’ve probably heard of Andrew Tate, he’s of the most ubiquitous faces on social media, but simultaneously one of the most controversial. He’s been described as a misogynist, and capable of radicalising men and boys to commit harm both off and online by numerous women’s and domestic abuse charities, but the funny thing is, he’s not some social outcast lurking in dark corners of the web, he’s one of the most famous people on social media, where videos of him have been watched over 11 billion times.
 Tate’s rise to fame was unexpected but not unplanned, evidence suggests the 35-year-old former kick boxer tasked his minions of young men and boys to flood social media with his most controversial videos and statements to give him attention and engagement fast. The effort to get Tate the attention he so desperately wanted has been estimated to have made him millions of pounds, most of this wealth coming from the 127,000 members of his Hustler’s University paying £39 a month in the promise of becoming a millionaire quick, the vast majority of ‘students’ being men and boys from the UK and US.

TikTok, where Tate receives most of his attention, claims to have a ‘zero tolerance policy for misogynistic content’, but instead of trying to limit his influence he has on impressionable teens and men, TikTok has propelled Tate into the mainstream and actively promotes him to young users. There is no denying that Tate is an attractive figure for men and boys to look up to; he’s a multiple world kick boxing champion, has an impressive collection of ridiculously expensive cars, lives an extravagant and flashy lifestyle and is seen with a many beautiful women at parties and on his yachts, but all of this just makes him more dangerous. In an age where young men are constantly given a skewed perception of what masculinity is and how they should treat women Andrew Tate just reinforces the wrong idea of the ’ideal’ man. Tate puts out that to be a man you must be ‘alpha’:  heterosexual, strong, dominating and in charge, treat women as your own who are there for your needs and wants. This toxic perception fed to impressionable young men is extremely worrying. Andrea Simon, the Director of the End Violence Against All Women campaign said ‘many of Tate’s videos clearly violate TikTok’s community guidelines’ and said that ‘the platform is facilitating and ultimately profiting from the potential radicalisation of young male users.

The dangers of Tate are not only from what he says but from what he does, in 2016 he lost his position in the Big Brother House after a video came out of him hitting a woman with a belt, a second video emerged of him telling a woman to count the bruises that he had given her, in 2017 deeply hateful tweets to gay people, and racial slurs were found,  then again in 2017 he went on to say that depression ‘ wasn’t real’, when the #MeToo movement began he stated that rape victims should ‘bear some responsibility’ for what had happened to them. Despite these deeply hateful and troubling comments, Tate was just pushed further into the spotlight. 

In the UK, where he was seen at events with Nigel Farage, Facebook photos show Tate with British Freedom Party Leader Tommy Robinson, after their meeting Tate described him as ‘a good guy’ with ‘a good heart’. If this doesn’t confirm Tate to be a man with hateful views that can lead to harm of people, then quite frankly what does? Love him or hate him, Tate is a figure who is very hard to avoid, and he is dangerous for a number of reasons. If anything, Tate just makes it all the more important to tell our sons and our brothers that men like this will only make the situation for young men and women worse, and that we all need to actively challenge views like his to make our society safer for women and girls and happier for men and boys.
