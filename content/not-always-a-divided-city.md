Kenmure Street, a perfectly ordinary Glasgow street flanked by the Victorian era sandstone tenements with small front gardens boasting rows of well kept hedges and bushes, walking up the street you would see a park, fitted with a basketball court, a beautiful building which remains a public library and of course a selection of local businesses, nothing particularly interesting or eye-catching, and never overly busy, apart from one seemingly ordinary Thursday in May of 2021, the day some have dubbed the ‘Battle for Kenmure Street’.

##### Kenmure street on a normal day.

The ‘battle’ began on the morning of Thursday 13 May, 2021, with two men being detained around 9-9:30a.m by a home office ‘dawn raid’, a method that has been heavily criticised across the UK but possibly nowhere else as heavily as in Glasgow, the only ‘dispersal city’ for asylum seekers in Scotland and home to the human rights group the ‘Glasgow Girls’, the city was a stronghold for the fight against dawn raids and the home office itself. Embodying this resistance, one local man now known as ‘Van Man’ would crawl under the back end of the home office van , preventing it from moving and ‘buying time’ for others to get to the scene. Glasgow, in particular the South Side where Kenmure street was located, has a strong and ever-growing activist network with a plethora of local charities supporting asylum seekers and the fight against their detention and deportation, these charities and organisations were responsible for mobilising the city and notifying locals of what was happening, soon after the initial call was sent out for help, hundreds had gathered in the small street and the vast majority of these people had no protest or activism experience, with school children still in uniform turning up after the school bells rang. It was clear that Glasgow was still firmly behind the Glasgow Girls.

##### Hundreds gathered around the home office van in Kenmure Street

For eight hours the men were held inside the van, hearing the growing crowd chanting “these are our neighbours let them go!” and “the people got the power, power to the people” outside, unaware of just how big of an event this was becoming. By early afternoon Police Scotland had sent in hundreds of officers to contain the peaceful protest, this act in itself attracted criticism as the protest was started, spread and organised to protect rather than harm. The increasing police presence started to create a rising sense of fear as protestors started to hear rumours about police horses approaching the protest. While the horses were kept well away from the protest police did attempt to clear a path towards the back end of the van, pushing and pulling protestors out of the way. With many of the protestors believing that they were about to be kettled they rushed from the pavements onto the road, kneeling down and preventing the police from moving further, or at least forcing them to be more violent if they did. The police would quickly give up and retreat but only after several small scuffles had broken out, resulting in arrests of those who pushed back.

##### Both men were eventually released after an 8 hour protest 

By the end of the day, when the two men were released from the van and escorted to a local mosque, 3 arrests had been made, forming the ‘Kenmure Street 3’. One year on from the protests they are appealing for the same public and political support the protest itself gained, creating a petition of change.org with over 800 signatures as of now to drop the charges against them, the trials will be held on the 3rd and 4th of August 2022 but the same network of activist groups that helped to spread awareness of the raid have been successful and unrelenting in their support for the 3, with near daily posts calling for their freedom and pleading for public support of the petitions, the 3 are quickly becoming another battle in the escalating war against the home office and if the petition works, the people win again. 

Being included on upday’s ‘ten protests that made a difference in 2021’ list it is clear to see that Kenmure Street has gained the publicity and worldwide support that is necessary if the movement is to really challenge and stop the home office and its inhumane practices. With growing resentment due to the plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda while they await on their asylum approval I doubt anyone would be surprised if Kenmure Street became the first of many protests across Scotland and the UK where locals stand up to protect their neighbours, spreading across the nation the Glaswegian ideology that leaders of the protest like the highly successful activist and lawyer Aamer Anwar would mention time and time again during the protest, that you become a Glaswegian as soon as you step foot in Glasgow you become neighbour worth fighting for.
