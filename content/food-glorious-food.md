## Opening a new front 

As of April 6th, 2022, a new law has been instated in the UK. All food and drink retailers with over 250 employees must show the calorie count for their products on: “menus, online menus, third party apps, food delivery platforms, and food labels” as well as the recommended intake of calories for adults. The intention of the rule was, indeed, a noble one, combatting the obesity crisis in Britain. Bridget Turner, Director of Policy, Campaigns and Improvement at Diabetes UK has said that: “Tackling this health crisis is vital, so the government’s commitment to making large takeaways, cafes and restaurant chains calorie-label the food they sell is a welcome move towards reducing the rising levels of obesity in the UK.”, and yes, some may see it as a “nudge in the right direction” but in the grand scheme of things, this “nudge” is likely to create more harm than health.

Fast-food giants are the first place most people think of when someone mentions obesity, calories or even just poor health in general, and yet McDonalds introduced calorie information on their menus back in 2011. 11 years later, McDonalds still holds a grip on virtually all parts of the country and according to their Q&A section they serve over 3.8million Brits a day. People love those golden arches. That’s the thing with calorie information – people are already in the door, looking at the menu because they like the food, because the food is cheap and easy or a mix of both. If people make it through the door, to the menu, the choice isn’t to have something or not, its what to have, this or that. This isn’t really the choice that the politicians and advisors behind it clearly think it is. Public Health Minister Maggie Throup said that the choice is something “We are used to knowing [this] when we are shopping in the supermarket, but this isn’t the case when we eat out or get a takeaway.”. What is ignored is that in a supermarket you can choose between the extremes, frozen pizzas and pies or sushi and rice bowls, multi-packs of crisps or tubs of grapes, the choice is there, and therefore calorie information and health advice is indeed helpful because you can see not only what is calorific but also what is not. You can make decisions about your health and cut down on pizzas and pies. It isn’t telling you that you’re doing something wrong, instead, it shows you that there are better choices. If restaurants had the choice of hundreds if not thousands of different foods and drinks and combinations of different foods then yes, calorie information wouldn’t create the uproar it has, but the closest you can get to that choice in a restaurant is, if your lucky, a couple of bland and overpriced salads, and you’re definitely not going to McDonalds for their carrot sticks

## McDonald's, McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and the constant reminder of our imperfections. Wait no, and a pizza hut!

The bottom line is that most of us go out to eat to have some fun, enjoy the experience, we go grocery shopping so we can eat and survive. If we had the choice between a McDonald’s and a salad bar, without any real evidence I think it’s safe to say most people would choose McDonald’s. In a world distorted by insane fitness trends, fad diets and the constant pressures of social media, everyone needs a bit of a cheat day, we know it’s bad for us, but that, ironically, is a healthy part of being human. We aren’t perfect, we like to eat and we especially like to eat the bad stuff, but constantly being told that it’s not okay to have these cheat days isn’t going to slash the £6.1 billion cost that obesity causes for the NHS because, as  Stuart Flint, director of the charity Obesity UK said: “The reality is there’s so many different factors that contribute to obesity,” and that it is “better to focus attention on restricting the availability of food, rather than placing the emphasis solely on individuals to make choices”. If there were healthy, but enjoyable, options in chain restaurants, takeaways and fast-food establishments, that is what would change people and their diet, not feeling guilty about choosing a “big-mac” over a “chicken legend”, because both are calorific, it just looks like a bunch of scary numbers on a page instead of a useful metric to inform you on your health. You can’t make McDonalds healthy, but you also can’t stop people from eating it (good try Jamie Oliver, good try).

###### The NHS created a number of advertisements to counter rising obesity rates

Promote healthy eating… obviously. But promote it in the places that either provide choice or information on healthy foods, supermarkets, Tv and radio, even roadside advertising, promote it everywhere you can except for in restaurants because if you tell someone who is eating somewhere clearly unhealthy that it’s unhealthy it isn’t going to get them to stand up and leave. They made the decision to go and eat there, it just perpetuates eating disorders and unhealthy crash diets because there is no good option in those establishments.  These create even more food-related expenses for the NHS, that £6.1 billion isn’t going anywhere until healthy products are made cheaper and more accessible in all areas of people’s lives, cheaper in supermarkets, available at the same ease as fast food and of course when it can taste good enough for us not to give into the temptation of a greasy bag of chips. It’s not about knowing the calories because that won’t stop people, it’s about having more healthy options.  Seriously, you will not stop people from going to McDonalds (or any other food place), but you can stop them from hating themselves for being human.  



## Halfway to healthy

Of course, there’s another side to this, the law was designed to help people, and it probably will help some. Maybe you are committing to a cutting/bulking program or simply trying to lay off a few pounds. This is what the law was designed to do, help people do this healthily and therefore become healthier. For those working to cut/bulk then yes this change is likely going to be fantastic for your journey as most people who commit to these diets have at least a basic understanding of how calories, macro and micro nutrients will affect them and therefore the calorie numbers will serve their purpose of informing. However, for the average joe, the healthier part is the problem. Supermarkets display not only calories but also nutritional information on fats, carbohydrates etc, these are key to a healthy diet. Only having calories, while helpful for sustaining a calorie deficit (eating fewer calories than you burn, this is needed to lose weight) it is also harmful to someone who is just starting their fitness journey or doesn’t know much about nutrition, e.g. many in the groups the law targets, the overweight and young. This is because purely calorie counting without much nutritional information just leads to you eating less, but there’s a large difference between eating a 500 calorie fast-food burger and a 500 calorie vegetable stew, as Shannon Finan, health and wellbeing officer for staff in Coventry and Rugby hospital theatres, told the BBC, “not all bad food is bad for you, you can have a bit of everything”, because even in that burger there is protein and, if you’re not as picky as myself, some vegetables in the gherkins. It’s about watching what’s in your food, carbs, proteins, fats, etc, having a balanced diet and then controlling portion sizes so you can have a mix of all those nutritional factors as well as cutting down on calories because if you just cut out masses of calories without changing the rest of your diet, likelihood is that you will be left ravenous and eventually give into those tempting calories, but if you start to eat healthier, more nutritional meals, they will help to reduce cravings and make you feel fuller. 

This law was designed to help the average Brit, especially those who are overweight, and the likelihood of the general public having done research on nutrition (past fad diets and the food pyramid) is minimal. So, if we are going to stick with this rule and really want this law to inform the public and to help them live healthier lives, there needs to be more than calories shown, like in supermarkets, and certainly more education and awareness on the topic of healthy eating.
