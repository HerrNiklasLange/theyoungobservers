###### Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (Rep)

Here’s a fun little game to play: type into Google ‘Florida man’ and your birthday. The results vary wildly, some rather humorous or curious and others far more morbid and dangerous. As I write this, the top hits on Google include for general ‘Florida man’ are: a man who shot and beat another man for walking his dog on a golf course and a citizen who is trying to ban the Christian Bible from Floridian schools as it has ‘casual’ mention of ‘murder, adultery and sexual immorality’. The latter pertains to a gentleman who is seemingly known for his tongue in cheek legal challenges and his actions were brought about by the fact that books including stories of people ‘coming out’ and including other LGBTQ themes were recently banned from being taught in schools. District authorities also banned 54 different maths textbooks as it was claimed they included ‘critical race theory’. ‘critical race theory’ is defined as an intellectual and social movement which seeks to examine the intersections of race, society and the law in America through recognising and researching the institutional and systemic nature of racism in America, not something you would expect to find in a maths textbook. But one of the biggest ‘Florida man’ to hit the headlines in recent months is the Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (pictured above) himself. He is responsible for signing into law legislation that brought about the afore mentioned changes to the books that can be taught in schools, and very recently a very wide-reaching bill that critics famously dubbed the ‘Don’t say Gay’ bill.  

 

The bill is actually named the ‘Parental Rights in Education’ bill and its supporters claim it is in place to prevent grooming by adult members of staff. The bill specifies that ‘classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards’. The bill caused outrage among LGBTQ groups, many recognising that the vague language used and the state’s power to sue in cases of violations will leave many school staff feeling scared and unable to discuss any LGBTQ related topics in classrooms, hence the nickname “don’t say gay”. There is also a strong understanding that the lack of education on LGBTQ topics could force many LGBTQ students to remain silent and make them feel isolated. As many members of the LGTBQ community already feel isolated due to the amount of hatred directed at them, not being able to confide in or talk with members of staff can only spell disaster and further their mental struggles. Unfortunately these types of situations are becoming all too common in America and the across the globe.  

 

As the Walt Disney Corporation operates (quite famously) out of Florida, attention quickly turned to them to put their support with the LGBTQ community and oppose the bill. After initially refusing to state their position on the matter, Disney backtracked and announced they did not support the bill. In response, Governor Ron DeSantis retaliated. Hard. 

 

American corporate giants have long held a reputation for making significant ‘donations’ to politicians and lobbying governments hard to get whatever they want and there is no greater example of this than the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The Reedy Creek Improvement District Act was passed in the State of Florida in 1967. Signed into law by the then Governor of Florida, Claude Kirk, it set up the land surrounding the Walt Disney World Resort as the Reedy Creek Improvement District with its own governmental authority. In a really rather smart decision, the bill specified members of this government were chosen by the majority land-owners in the district, who are of course Disney. Furthermore, as its own independent district with a government, the RCID has practically free reign to implement its own laws and only follows state laws on property laws and elevator inspections. Hence, as Disney controls who runs the RCID and as it isn’t obliged to follow almost all state laws, Disney effectively has free range to do whatever they want. As such, originally Walt Disney did actually have plans to build actual housing on the land. His idea was to build an ‘Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow’ however after his death the plans were mostly abandoned. The area became what is now Celebration, a town run by Disney utility companies with over 11,000 residents, however you may notice it shares its name with the now famous EPCOT park. In retaliation to Disney speaking out over the legislation, Governor DeSantis passed legislation that would dissolve the RCID, effective June 1 2023.  

 

Deciding to remove the main economic benefit of one of the largest employers in the state could certainly be viewed as a rather harsh and rash decision and as is the way with rash decisions, more people will be hurt by this than those who benefit. One of the most notable changes that residents in surrounding areas of Florida will notice once the district is dissolved is an increase in taxes. RCID runs its own tax system (which inevitably feeds back to Disney) so the financing of the: police and fire stations, maintenance of their 6-lane motorways, sewage systems, electrical utilities and water systems will inevitably fall to the local citizens rather than the Walt Disney Corporation. On top of this, the bold move from DeSantis to publicly strip Disney of its economic advantages will surely scare away other businesses in future. With the threat of fierce retaliation from political figures if companies step out of line with Government ideals, it's not beyond reason that other corporations will decide not to operate in Florida to avoid penalty. For example; with the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v Wade, how many companies support that? Most notably, according to a leaked memo Amazon is projected to run out of warehouse workers by 2024 due to its extreme turnover rate and yet in May 2022 they announced that they would be supporting women in ‘red’ states by allowing them to get up to $4,000 a year to travel for non-life-threatening medical care (including abortions). For a megacompany that has a distinct reputation for showing little care for their workers (if you didn’t know this, please Google ‘Amazon despair closet’. Yes, you are reading that right. A small cubicle with Ama-zen videos is the best solution they could think of for their underpaid, overworked, employees; in some states these full-time workers are paid so little they do in fact qualify for benefits), even they are committed to showing more care to workers seeking safe abortions than Republicans. So returning back to my point, how long is it before DeSantis and other Republicans get upset over Amazon (and quite a few other large companies) opposing their legislation on issues such as abortion and decide to punish them too? 

 

Personally, I don’t believe that companies putting their support in their female employees will spark a national revolution where they are all simultaneously bombarded by politicians. Starbucks, Tesla, Levi’s, Uber, Match (the dating app), Disney and many other large companies that operate across the US in red states have openly shown support and provided financial support for female employees seeking abortions, very much contrary to Republican policy, and so far have faced no major repercussions, but in reality not many of them have such massive economic advantages, like being their own government, that Republicans can take away from them. For now, DeSantis dissolving the RCID will remain a just a reminder of the power politicians hold and how wildly they wield it, a stark warning to any considering speaking out against them.
