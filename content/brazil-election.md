Today one of the biggest and youngest democracy votes in what is it called one of the most important elections in years, according to the BBC but why is that? And how may this election impact the next presidential elections in the United States?
Jair Bolsonaro, right wing populist, stands for reelection, but pools suggest that he will lose to form left wing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, or Lulu for short. Lulu has nearly a 10-point lead with 45% of Brazilians gone vote for Lulu and only 37% planning to vote for the current president Bolsonaro.

 Similar to the 2020 US election who have two ideological opposite forces, but that are sadly not the only similarities we are seeing. Just like Trump who is still claiming that he won the election Bolsonaro claims that if he doesn’t get 60% of the total vote in the first round of the election today – which would make him re-elected as president “something abnormal must have happened with the Electoral Court “, the only different is that Bolsonaro has military ties and that could well lead to military coup lead by his supports, if he loses the vote and he cannot accept the reality of his defeat. This could well mean start of a bloody civil war and the end of democracy for Brazil. If Bolsonaro wins or loses, Brazilian democracy is at threat. Constantly question Ballots and crying out accusations of voter fraud without claim, Bolsonaro is a danger, to democracy like Trump was. The only hope for Brazilian democracy is that Bolsonaro respects the peoples will no matter what and will not stir up political violence across Brazil like the January 5th assault on the Capital hill in America, Trump stirred up. The world is watching closely, as not only the future of the Rainforest in on the line, but also a potential insight into the next US election.
