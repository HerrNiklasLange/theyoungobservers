Plato once said that “Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything”, surely if we want the children in our society to flourish, we should be using every form of aid they can. 

Every teacher has their own reasons for preventing their students from listening to music in class – maybe its too loud or too distracting. Their solution? Ban it from their classroom. Now, sometimes they’re right to prevent music being played, such as during a hands on lessons or when a complicated explanation is needed but that’s obvious, however outside of those situations, students should be free to listen to music of their choice during class time and if this is done we may see benefits to mental health, memory and motivation and these benefits clearly outweigh the negatives. 

 

 

Music in the classroom isn’t a new phenomenon, every one of us has already seen the benefits of music in terms of learning already, many without even noticing. At the most basic level we have used repetitive music and rhythm to learn our ABCs and the basic grammar in languages. There’s good reason for this, children react to repetition of sounds, they stick in their heads easily and can be remembered with ease because of the repetitive cycle. That’s a large reason as to why everyone remembers nursery rhymes even if they haven’t heard them for 10+ years, it’s the rhythm. We all know our ABCs, don’t we? So why should we stop using this technique, that we know works, when we are presented with more complicated subjects or larger quantities of work? Well, I’ve got a simple answer - we shouldn’t.  

 

 

The benefit music has on helping us remember groups of information isn’t the only reason why it should be utilised far more in schools. Music is already used as a therapy technique to help people suffering with depression and anxiety and with the mental health crisis amongst UK students this sounds like a perfect way to help reduce the number of students who dread even walking into school. Teenagers suffer from a huge amount of stress , in fact in 2000 it was reported that school children ‘suffered from more stress and anxiety than child psychiatric patients in the 50s’ and that his terrible trend would only continue in the following decades, we have seen a huge spike in mental health issues in children since the outbreak of Covid-19, so what better to counter this terrible increase than music, a familiar, customisable and proven method with many  studies producing statistics that show that music can help. A BBC article stated that; “levels of dopamine were found to be up to 9% higher when volunteers were listening to music they enjoyed.” While music doesn’t have the medical capabilities to cure depression or any complex issues like that, it does have the ability to relax listeners and help them escape from the stress of everyday life. This will in turn help children to concentrate better in class and perform better as well  with the lowered level of stress helping them to focus on their work. Surely that’s all teachers can ask for? 

 

One part of the school year that many students’ despairs is the public speaking or presentation areas of the course. Whether this is due to anxiety, shyness, or self-consciousness, it is hard for many. This is yet another aspect of a child’s education where music can be a useful tool. Music therapy is a common technique in helping people overcome stutters and talk even when suffering from social anxiety. An example of this can be seen in the movie “The Kings Speech” where King George is shown to receive speech therapy to overcome his stutter, music was the most significant aid. While this section of the movie is not entirely accurate and merely based off rumours there is good reason for it being kept in the final cut. Music therapy is comfortable and familiar for the patient and is there for completely within the realm of possibility that the king could have received it. The rhythm and the partial distraction the music introduces helps the speaker to form clearer sounds, words and sentences than before, while the movie was not exactly what happened, it is a reality for many. This shows that music is already accepted as a method of helping people talk in front of an audience so there should be an incentive to allow children to use it when presenting or talking in class as they will feel far more comfortable with some music in their ear and over time they will develop the skill and maybe grow out of needing it as an aid. Afterall, if its good enough for the king, it’s good enough for anyone. 


Not only can music directly aid a student’s ability to learn but it also has indirect effects such as the ability to motivate pupils. Many subjects have songs made about different topics within them. One of these bands could be Sabaton who produce music about historical events. If students can enjoy a piece of music about a subject, they study it is likely that this will make them more engaged in class, not only does this put less pressure on the teacher to explain complex topics but It is also something that could easily be implemented into lessons and would benefit many students. The power of music that relates to school subjects isn’t just limited to motivation either – listen to it a few times and you’ll remember most of the words which contain the information you need in the class – repetition is key for memory and songs are a much more enjoyable thing to repeat than tests. 


Text BoxMusic and learning isn’t exactly a new concept and many point to the debunked “Mozart Theory” to show why music should not be permitted in a classroom, the theory explores the possibility that a child listening to classical music – in particular music by Mozart - before an assessment on a range of spatial tests, these pupils would perform better than one who had not listened to the same thing. This theory has been debunked and there is now evidence to show that there isn’t any direct correlation between classical music and intelligence or IQ, one of the main faults of the theory is that the sample size of evidence was very small. Although music may not be able to directly influence a child’s intelligence it is the benefits to other aspects of a child’s life, such as an improved mental health, that could positively impact their intelligence, music is much more powerful as a tool used to ease a students nerves or to motivate them to learn about the subject than as a tool to miraculously boost your grades thanks to “Piano Concerto No. 21”. We can see the scientific results of music and what teacher is going to argue with results?
