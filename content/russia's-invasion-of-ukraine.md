Many elderly members of our society will still remember the shocking events of World War 2, some younger people too will have fought through the horrific events in Afghanistan and Iraq, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is in a different era where combat has changed dramatically. This isn’t just a war of bullets and blood, but also of information and words.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine comes at a time when young people don’t even need to be on the scene to witness the atrocities and alleged war crimes being committed in Eastern Europe. Through the rise of social media and instant communication, from the moment the first shell struck and the preliminary waves of tanks and trucks rolled onto Ukrainian soil, footage of the supposed ‘special military operation’ ran riot across social media. Right from the beginning of Putin’s video announcement on the 24th of February, he has avoided (at all costs) using the words ‘attack’, ‘invasion’ and ‘war’. His choice to describe it as a ‘special military operation’ – along with much of his propaganda being fed through state TV – has kept a fair portion of the Russian population entirely unaware of exactly what’s going on in Ukraine. Of course, with most of Russia’s younger population being conscripted, many scared parents would, at the drop of a hat, stop supporting Putin’s actions to keep their children safe. Putin confirmed that (in line with Russian law) conscripts would be kept well away from any direct conflict, instructed instead to keep Russia’s flailing supply chain of munitions and food alive, yet reports have emerged that not only has the Russian Ministry of Defence ignored this, but gone a step further to coerce some soldiers into signing contracts of voluntary service to change their legal standing and allow them to be sent to the front line. Whilst this is obviously never going to be talked about by the Russian State, they legally don’t have to anyway. Since 2015, military deaths have been a state secret, keeping distraught parents firmly in the dark.  This lack of information and updates has left many parents scrambling to get any information about the whereabouts of their children. Not too long ago, the United Nations delegate for Ukraine read out (in the General Assembly) text messages from young soldiers to their parents which demonstrated that they were under the impression that they indeed would be deployed to the annexed Crimea, yet they found themselves in direct, violent, conflict in Ukraine. Further to this, the Ukrainian people have yet again shown their endless compassion and sympathies for the oblivious personnel by even setting up hotlines for Russian mothers to call and check on their children’s’ condition. Despite not having access to the data and resources of the Russian Ministry of Defence, ordinary Ukrainian citizens are showing that they understand that this is Putin’s war, not Russia’s war. With soldiers being used as disposably as this, surely Putin’s biggest worry is losing the support of his own people? There is already well documented dissent among the Russian population, clips of any and all deemed to be protesting being bundled into vans (even young children) are spreading through Western media and surely appearing on Russian social media too. But sometimes people are just so set in their ways that nothing can change their mind. Prime example: an on-the-ground journalist recently shared a tweet explaining that he’d met a Ukrainian salon owner who had had her premises broken in to, looted, robbed and vandalised. Upon escaping, she called her Aunt who lived in Moscow and explained the situation only to be met with an aggressive backlash of ‘they must have been Ukrainians dressed up, they’ve really brainwashed you there’. Clearly for now, Russian media, the FSB and the threat of time in Siberian labour camps has most of the population quiet but has Putin failed to learn from the past and could he find himself suffering the same fate as the grand Soviet Union he seems to be trying to replicate? Social media is a powerful tool that can spread information faster than it can be contained, slowly bringing the Russian people to the horrible truth of what’s actually happening in Ukraine. Once the truth is out, will his people stand by him or will it be his Achilles heel? Only time will tell.

Whilst it is entirely unfair on many nations around the world to pretend that no conflict whatsoever has taken place while social media has been around, social media has never been more prevalent than now and that’s what distinguishes this from others in recent times. During the invasion of Iraq and other conflicts in the Middle East, changes in the style of journalism allowed on-the-ground crews to operate in real-time, feeding back images and videos to anchors across the globe. This brought a whole new perspective on conflicts occurring, as opposed to the vague titles and blurry black and white photos printed during the first and second world war. Viewers can now see the violence first hand and form more informed opinions on exactly what is going on. The difference now is that the closeness between the content viewer and content creator has been put on steroids. In a similar fashion to the withdrawal of foreign forces in Afghanistan and subsequent fall of government forces, people of all ages and from all corners of the globe have instant access to up-to-date news on any and every intimate aspect of events. Ukrainian citizens have gone viral for documenting their lives under fire and in the safety of bunkers. Users have also been urged to avoid giving away military movements by not posting units moving past them, but conversely many are plastering as much footage of transiting Russian units as possible. It’s through this widespread want for real-life content that has given us a rather accurate view into how Russian forces have in fact stalled in their attempts to sweep through the country. Alongside the footage of citizens surviving, there has been much documentation of Ukrainians towing away Russian tanks and trucks, even abandoned jets, and offering lifts back to the border for tanks that have run out of fuel, confronting soldiers, telling them to go home, accepting and reassuring defectors and also spreading genuine advice on how to survive. Even from the far reaches of the edge of space, the New York Times has published satellite images of dead civilians left in the street, shocking and real evidence of Putin’s war crimes. Because social media platforms have such a wide reach, even ex-military engineers in the US can pass on their advice on how to confuse and disrupt the movements of tanks, something entirely unimaginable even just 20 years ago. The list goes on and on, covering all aspects of the invasion and how it’s being thwarted, this only goes to show that it is almost impossible, these days, to keep anything secret from the world.

Unfortunately, crisis has (as always) presented an opportunity for some to make their own gains. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram have been covered in videos using fearmongering to attract attention to their accounts. User have been purporting to be issuing Government advice on how to survive nuclear attacks and large-scale bombs. While Ukrainian citizens find whatever shelter they can, so-called ‘experts’ on social media try to increase their followers by posting (mostly) made-up advice, yet further demonstrating that some people will just always have their own interests at heart. Conversely, this crisis has also presented an opportunity for all of us – around the world – to once again come together in solidarity against Putin’s regime, irrespective of any personal gains. Many businesses, like Vodafone, offering their services free of charge to any Ukrainians and many others donating products and money to help keep refugees warm and safe. Naturally, some have the desire to take a much more literal approach to helping out and the British Ministry of Defence confirmed that multiple personnel had seemingly abandoned their posts across Britain to join the recently created International Legion of Territorial Defence of Ukraine (also known as the Ukrainian Foreign Legion) which drew wide condemnation and even threats of court-marshalling from Government officials. Whilst criticism was mostly aimed at those who abandoned their posts, it was also highlighted that it could easily be misconstrued by Russians that serving members of the Armed Forces of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland could, in fact, be participating in this war. Undoubtedly, this would be the golden opportunity for Vladimir Putin to claim escalation on Ukraine’s side and opt to use weapons of mass/assured destruction to maintain the integrity of Russia’s borders that would seemingly be under attack from other Western nations. My hope is that the continued press and constant posts on social media around the situation will keep the Ukrainian people’s struggles firmly in the spotlight as this is the least Western nations can continue to do. I hope that the horrific reports coming out of Bucha (a town around 16 miles from Kyiv) of civilians being found in mass graves with their hands tied as they were shot in the back of the head, keep coming so we never forget how truly terrible ordinary people are being treated. I hope our leaders continue to send cutting-edge weapons to give ordinary civilians a chance against the tanks rolling through their streets. I hope Ukraine doesn’t become another Crimea, I hope we never forget the lives Putin has stolen and forgive him for the world he has created. I hope it comes to an end soon and no one ever has to go through this ever again. 

While the internet continues to feed us mountains of data, another frontier of modern warfare came in to play; financial. Putin has always had a rather cosy relationship with the Russian Oligarchs. Similar to most Tory peers (and anyone else who has lived within a 5 mile radius of Matt Hancock) post-2020, Russia’s richest have a long history of becoming only more rich through Government connections. They were well known to be buying up various firms and companies after the fall of the Soviet Union and proceeding to making lucrative returns on other investments through dubious means. Roman Abramovich (owner of Chelsea Football Club) even admitted on record that he had bribed officials for favours and security after acquiring a former Soviet oil company. Whilst being sued by a former business partner in 2012, he admitted in a UK court that he had given said partner $10 million to pay off a Kremlin insider to rig the auction of his oil firm (Sibneft) in 1995. He bought the company for $250 million and sold it back to the Russian Government in 2005 for $13 billion, thus amassing his significant wealth. I highlight the intricacies in his particular case as there are many like it, while the Soviet Union crumbled before the eyes of the world, a select few with good enough contacts grabbed the opportunity and find themselves absurdly rich today. Unfortunately they were smart enough to not keep this wealth in Russia, and so we find ourselves at the Economic Crime Bill. Many Oligarchs bought mansions in Central London, docked Superyachts around Europe and filled banks accounts in Monaco and Switzerland with their cash. The Economic Crime Bill aims to paper over the loophole that allows foreigners to anonymously buy property in the UK and show the public who really owns what. Meanwhile, Switzerland and Monaco too have aligned themselves with the rest of Europe by announcing wide-ranging economic sanctions against Russian individuals and companies. Their choice to do so means that all the wealth stashed in foreign accounts is no longer immune to the sanctions aimed directly at Russia. This policy of mostly economic sanctions instead of direct military incursions definitely represents a change since the last century. Most global leaders have recognised that deploying military forces would be detrimental and a clear escalation of the situation and so have instead resorted to financially crippling Russia. As frustrating as it is for the West to stand by and watch as citizens are targeted with bullets and bombs, it’s all we can do without raining down the vast resources of Russia upon the rest of the world. Economic sanctions appear to be doing the trick, if it weren’t for Europe’s reliance on Russian oil and gas, they would be all but financially cut off from the rest of the world. The Ruble was in steady decline but took a steep dive in late February to the extent that it was no longer worth a single US cent. More recently, Putin demanded that any gas and oil must be purchased in Rubles, a last grab attempt to prop up a currency that has somewhat recovered, but the question remains whether Russia could collapse in on itself financially before troops take Kyiv. Putin has now announced that his ‘special military operation’ has been scaled back somewhat, focusing more on strengthening and supporting the phony areas of Eastern Ukraine that he has recognised as independent regions however it is becoming more apparent, day by day, that either his advisors aren’t being very honest with him or he’s well aware of how badly his invasion is going and is attempting to cut his losses. He’s also doing his best to diplomatically end these economic sanctions, ordering his cosmonauts to cease cooperation aboard the international Space Station until they‘re lifted. Evidently, this has changed no one’s mind and has only further revealed the lengths he will go to before he waves his white flag. Whilst many consider economic sanctions to be frustratingly ineffective, they play out very well in the long run and could just be the key to squeezing Putin into further scaling back his ‘special miliary operation’.

What happens from here remains as much a mystery as the future has always been and as unpredictable as Putin has always been. The West can’t get involved for fear of escalation and Russia seems to be just about holding it together in the face of the economic sanctions that have been put in place, a perfect stalemate of both sides being left with no options other than to continue their respective status quo. But for as long as this ghastly conflict continues, it will never fail to surprise and inspire me how this conflict is fought and managed, how people will survive and never give up, how the fundamentals of democracy and freedom will continue being the David in the face of a Soviet Union sized Goliath.
