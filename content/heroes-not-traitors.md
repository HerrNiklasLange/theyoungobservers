1.7 million classified documents stolen from the inside , three felonies, Yet a peoples’ hero. How can this be? The answer comes from famed whistle-blower Edward Snowden: “What is right is not always the same as what is legal”. The definition of a whistle-blower allows us the understand this further: “an individual who, without authorization, reveals private or classified information about an organisation, usually related to wrongdoing or misconduct” . Whistleblowing is much more than simply ‘telling tales’, it’s about protecting others. We were taught that being a tattletale made you untrustworthy back when we were blissfully unaware of any real wrongdoing, this idea must change as we age and develop a deeper understanding of the world around us. Whistle-blowers have been able to do this, consistently bringing to light severe breaches in law, trust and ethics. Therefore, it is necessary to better protect them through the law and to encourage people to come forward because their actions benefit society by preventing corruption from being swept under the rug.

What stops firms and governments from doing as they please? Whistle-blowers. One such instance of a whistle-blower being able to expose malpractice was in the 2013 fraud case involving Johnson & Johnston. They were accused of aggressively marketing Risperdal, a drug that was not approved for use by children or the elderly, to nursing home workers and child psychologists.  The drug was marketed as being effective in controlling behaviouralproblems, anxiety and depression in children and the elderly; however, they failed to mention the increased risks of strokes and contracting diabetes in the elderly and the irregular growth of breast tissue in children, leading to boys developing large breasts with reports of one boy growing breasts as large as 42DD . By ignoring these dangers, J&J were able to make a killing. The power that whistle-blowers have is clear as J&J were forced to pay $2.2 billion as a settlement in 2013. Without the bravery of whistle-blowers, J&J would likely have been left unscathed, yet whistleblowing is still regarded as a negative. In fact, whistle-blowers often receive a huge amount of backlash, especially from their employers. Fraud Magazine found that: “Seventy-four percent of the whistle-blowers in my review were terminated. Another 6 percent were suspended, and 5 percent transferred against their wishes. The remaining 15 percent were given poor evaluations, demoted, or harassed.”  This is unacceptable. 
An example of someone in that 74% is Katherine Gun, the whistle-blower responsible for the reveal of the joint US-UK plan to illegally swing the UN security council vote in favour of an invasion of Iraq. She leaked a memo from Frank Koza, Defence Chief of Staff at the NSA asking for the support of UK intelligence services to aid in the surveillance and bugging of the offices of six ‘swing nations’ that were: “all key to the passing of a second UN resolution on Iraq”  if this resolution was to be passed then the invasion of Iraq would be deemed legal. She leaked the document to the press in the hope that public outcry would deter the government from assisting the US. Although this did not happen, the effect the leak had on fuelling anti-war movements was immense.

Her heroics cannot be seen as a failure. Her court case caused international embarrassment to the UK and US, on top of creating a martyr for the anti-war movement. The leak is viewed as being a strong driving force for the growth of the anti-war protests that took place in 2003. Record-breaking protests across Europe with 3 million in Rome , 1.5 million in Madrid and similar protests erupting across 60 countries in a single weekend.  Outrage was felt across the world and Gun was deemed a hero by millions.  She was later released after; “the prosecution realised that evidence would emerge at Gun’s trial that even British government lawyers believed the invasion was unlawful.” . Gun risked everything attempting to stop the bloodshed of war and yet she was the one punished! She broke the law, yes, but so did the war. A war that caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. As Snowden said, “What is right is not always the same as what is legal”. 

The hope is that the support for whistle-blowers across the world will act as a deterrent. This is an important reason why people put their lives on the line to blow the whistle – if enough issues are raised, supported, and discussed, it becomes much harder for them to be ignored.

The unfortunate truth is that, as mentioned previously, whistle-blowers are frequently punished for raising these issues. Another case of unjust punishment is that of Kathryn Bokovac, the former human rights investigator who worked for UN contractor DynCorp (the company was contracted to train police officers). She blew the whistle on widespread sex trafficking, use of prostitution and rape which included the rape of underage girls, in Bosnia.  UN officers were exempt from prosecution. Some were forced to resign and leave Bosnia, but the vast majority faced no punishment. Instead, Bolkovac was fired from her post under the claim of falsifying timesheets. This was later proven to be a false reason for termination. Bolkovac filed a lawsuit for unfair dismissal as she should have been protected under the protected disclosure agreement – commonly known as the whistleblowing agreement. 

This isn’t an isolated incident either, whistle-blowers are commonly seen as an inconvenience and therefore are treated as such. Another example is Thomas Drake who exposed the NSA’s mass surveillance program and he even followed the law step by step. Abiding by US whistleblowing laws, using official and internal lines of communication rather than the press as well as acknowledging the espionage act. However, “Drake was fired, arrested at dawn by gun-wielding FBI agents, stripped of his security clearance, charged with crimes that could have sent him to prison for the rest of his life, and all but ruined financially and professionally.”  This is one of many examples of completely legal whistle-blowers being punished even when abiding by the laws set up to protect them. If the laws set up to aid those exposing malpractice can be ignored and exploited to punish the whistle-blowers, then positive change becomes virtually impossible. These laws must be tightened and held up to protect the individual who decides to stand up for what is right, and punish those who have committed the real crimes.

The argument against whistle-blowers is that the law is the law and must be upheld no matter the context. This claim can be easily countered through evidence shown previously, through J&J’s marketing campaign and the illegal war in Iraq, that organisations and governments repeatedly break laws that directly harm the public. They are so often left unpunished, or the punishment is far too lenient. Yet those who expose this illegal activity are punished and on a much harsher level; How is it fair that those who aim to protect society become the criminals, not the heroes.

Just a month ago the UK approved Julian Assange’s extradition back to the US. Assange is charged with violating the espionage act and faces 175 years in prison for his whistleblowing heroics. He was the man behind ‘wikileaks’, a non-profit organisation that Assange used to leak classified documents that showed evidence of US war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. WikiLeaks have provided possibly the most important quote of this entire post, “Julian did nothing wrong. He has committed no crime and is not a criminal. He is a journalist and a publisher and he is being punished for doing his job”.  He has been punished for exposing the truth to the public and yet those who authorised these war crimes haven’t been punished. Who’s the real criminal here? I hope everyiraqone sees the pattern.

It is odd for an individual dead-set on revealing information for the protection of others to be labelled as a felon. It’s also unusual for laws meant to protect people to be ignored. Companies, and especially governments hold a fundamental fear of whistle-blowers, the fear that they, above almost anything else, have the power to destroy their plans, strategies, and most importantly, reputation. The power that whistle-blowers hold is crucial to our comfort, safety and privacy as citizens. If these laws are so easily ignored, even in the face of widespread support for the whistle-blower as well the criticism and vitriol targeting the accused, then it is of crucial importance that these laws are reinforced and upheld to protect the whistle-blowers and to encourage more people to come forward and blow the whistle. Afterall, the world could use a few more heroes nowadays.
