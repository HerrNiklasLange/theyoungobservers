## A Fragile Alliance
The cracks are already beginning to appear in the ‘Glasgow Climate Pact’ and with the climate crisis looming those cracks may prove to be more powerful than the Pact itself. While the promises made would, in theory, keep global warming below 2 degrees (many estimates hone in on the 1.8°C mark) and keep the goal of 1.5°C alive, that could be very different in practice, as the COP26 president, Alok Sharma, said; “at the moment they are just words on a page”.

## Mitigation – A rocky past and a turbulent future.

The pact has been split into four categories: Mitigation, Adaptation & Loss and Damage, Finance and Collaboration, this article will focus on Mitigation as it is the category with the most potential to swing the entire climate crisis one way or the other, towards safety or further away than ever.

It has been by far the most controversial section of the conference, with debates about both the phrasing and demands of the Pact itself dragging on for hours, past the expected end of the conference, eventually these long and arduous negotiations ended in tears for the COP president, Alok Sharma, and a victory for the coal giants of India and China. They place 1st (China) and 2nd (India) on the coal production charts and are therefore topping the table for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions too with China accounting for 30% of GHG emissions worldwide. Despite coming close to an agreement, the Glasgow Pact was forced to “water down” its phrasing for the demands on cutting coal consumption from “phase out” to “phase down” due to pressure from the two nations – this small change may seem pointless and inconsequential but in reality it severely limits the effect of this demand and allows China and India to continue their heavy reliance on coal without going against the agreement, they aren’t required to get rid of their dependency on coal and the pledge they made to reduce coal usage will take years to implement and many more to complete. In fact Chinese coal consumption is likely to rise for the next few years as the Chinese government has only pledged to start cutting the industry post-2025, allowing for new coal developments and expansions to go ahead in the meantime including the new Shanghaimiao plant, soon to be the largest coal power plant in China which when completed will produce 4,000 Megawatts of power and will spray GHG emissions into the atmosphere only adding to the problem of coal power in the developing world. The watering down of this agreement has allowed China to retain and in fact increase their coal consumption, which is dangerously against the entire idea, promises and hopes of COP26 and has led to the biggest polluter (more than double the CO2 output than the 2nd place USA) on Earth to continue favouring its own development over the safety and protection of the Earth as a whole. With no accountability, enforcement or even real, strict agreements about coal consumption it can be predicted with near certainty that the conference did not do enough, failing to pin down one of the largest polluting industries is enough to make the 1.5°C target unreachable and as of now the fate of the coal industry and the emissions it creates is left, once again, to the leaders of coal-dependant and ever-growing nations. The fate of COP26 will rest, frustratingly, in China, post-2025.

###### A coal power plant in China – one of over 1,000



To make it all worth it the Chinese plans to cut down on coal must be swift and must be on a large scale and similar plans must be created across the developing world, including India and all the Chinese or Indian ran coal plants in Africa, while the ability for this initiative to be a success it could easily become worse, with developing nations across the world growing at rapid rates and therefore requiring more and more cheap energy, which unfortunately, as it stands, means cheap coal, the weight seems to be leaning towards a failure.

With the fate of coal up in the air but looking increasingly negative we must look at the next mitigation method, controlling deforestation – a huge win (well, on paper) for the Pact.

In total 137 world leaders “committed to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030”, one of nations that signed was a delegation from Brazil, home the largest forest on Earth, the Amazon. Brazil has pledged to end illegal deforestation in the nation, which accounts for an estimated 90% of all deforestation in the country, which would allow the “Earth’s Lung” to recover from overlogging, forest fires and clearing, among other forms of deforestation, and therefore could have a huge impact on keeping CO2 levels on Earth down by absorbing billions of metric tonnes of the gas.

###### Deforestation and clearing of the Amazon in Brazil

 In fact, Brazil has pledged to speed up the process of stopping deforestation and complete the aim by 2028. This all sounds amazing, but the unfortunate truth is that Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has a track record of disregarding environmental concerns and continuing to destroy the rainforest for profit (mining, logging, clearances for farming etc). He failed to join other national leaders at the conference and has repeatedly cut funding to the already underfunded Environment Ministry in Brazil. He has shown no previous care for the environment and the protection of the Amazon so it begs the question – why would this change now? Clearing the Amazon creates profit through mining and farming, why would greed not win at this moment? This aim from COP26 can only succeed if greed, somehow, doesn’t win, Bolsonaro must prioritise the protection of the Amazon because a safe and stable climate will benefit everyone, including Brazil.

 Once again, this aim has been left hanging by the lack of accountability that the Glasgow Pact created and only time will tell if Mr Bolsonaro holds true to his countries promises, but if plans do go ahead, especially for Brazil’s new 2028 target which would be very fast for a mitigation method that could have a huge impact on global CO2 levels, this side of the deal could be a huge success. Now, we must hold our breathes.

Will COP26 successfully mitigate climate change? Probably not. The key word that explains why seems to be accountability. With China not making any progress on the coal front until 2025 and Brazil’s commitment to the 2028 goal being questionable to say the least it all looks like too little too late and the fragile Glasgow Pact is looking increasingly like a document of promises but nothing more, there is no accountability if the rough dates and targets aren’t met and with “watered down” demands the Pact is made even weaker. In the end it comes down to selfishness, us vs them, most governments seem to be more focused on their own economic growth and industry rather than a collective effort to mitigate climate change because the two can’t always work together, sacrifices must be made if we want COP26 to be successful, but sacrifices have never exactly been popular.
