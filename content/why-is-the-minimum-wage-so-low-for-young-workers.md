With the cost of living crisis causing huge problems across the country due to the adult minimum wage not being enough to support millions of families, it begs the question – how on earth could someone live off half of it? There are a few main arguments as to why younger workers should earn less, and this post will explore two of the biggest: competition in the labour market and a perceived lesser need for money.

### Competition

This is the one which is probably the easiest to dissect and digest. The common conception is that the younger you are, the less employable you are, and for many, especially in the 16-17 year old age bracket this is true. You’re still in school, you have no experience, no degree, no professional references, on the surface yeah, it’s not exactly a great start. However, you don’t need a degree, 10 years of experience or, in most cases, even a reference for the jobs 16 year olds will be looking for. From being a cashier to a barista, there is one line that is virtually always included in the job description: “you don’t need to have experience, just a willingness to learn”. That one line flips everything on its head. Expectation – the managers of these companies know that anyone can do the job with minimal training, whether it’s behind a cash register or an espresso machine. So are teenagers and young adults still at such a huge disadvantage, even for the jobs that don’t even require a CV to apply, that halving their minimum wage is necessary? I’d say no. Even if experience is required, school itself gives plenty of multidisciplinary skills and in some cases, experience. With public speaking, teamwork and leadership all being developed through sports, group projects and competitions and awards like Duke Of Edinburgh promoting further skill development on top of volunteering, which is a very useful and easy way to gain experience in retail or similar industries, teenagers aren’t always on the bottom ring and with computing expertise owing to younger generations growing up surrounded with technology and the hard working attitude that comes with balancing a 6-8 hour school day, homework and extracurricular activities all on top of a part time job, there’s more reasons than purely money for someone to employ a teenager.

### Need

Here’s my biggest problem with the young minimum wage. The assumption that young workers don’t need the money to survive thanks to parental support and a lack of dependants (children, elderly family members etc). The UK school leaving age is 16, with many Scots entering university at 17 after completion of their 5th year. You can drive at 17, get married at 16 and even vote (in Scotland) at 16,  yet apparently you have half of the costs of a married, enfranchised adult who drives on the same road to the same job. 
With the value of a degree falling, and the salary required to start paying back student loans also falling, young people will be increasingly faced with financial hardship as they struggle to get through university, away from home, paying for rent and food themselves. But fear not, when the do leave university, in general around the 22-23 year old mark, their financial struggles are over as they can finally be paid… minimum wage…
And it seems that there is no escape as even if they choose to find an apprenticeship instead of university (or following it), their financial struggles will continue as the minimum rate of pay remains absurdly low. And this is them working in industries that would require experience, a good CV and great references to break into, yet they still aren’t treated to anything near the living wage. And people wonder why young people complain.

With the cost of living rising every day, the prospect of owning a house becoming a more and more unattainable goal for many and the responsibilities that young people already have, it is unreasonable for them to be expected to live off of £4.81 an hour, student discounts aren’t THAT amazing.
